two-thirds of which was methane from livestock and manure.A new report said livestock farms needed to ""redirect"" as society decarbonises to meet climate goals.The Welsh government said it was taking action to ensure a ""just transition"" to net zero.Wales, like the UK, has a legally binding target to reach net zero by 2050 which means dramatically cutting greenhouse gas emissions.What does net zero mean?New UK plan to reach net zero goal faces criticismCould Welsh farms help hit climate change targets?But the body which advises ministers on climate change predicted these changes could have ""significant impacts"" on the farming workforce.Between 7,000 and 42,000 jobs could be lost across the UK unless livestock farms adapt the nature of their work, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) estimated.Sheep farmer Ian Rickman, 61, said the older generation needed ""training and help to embrace new technologies and ways of working"".""Producing food more efficiently"" could help to lower the carbon footprint of farms, which were keen to be ""part of the solution"" on climate change, he said.'I do worry for the future'Mr Rickman, who is deputy president of the Farmers' Union of Wales, recently brought in 26-year-old Sean Jeffreys as a partner at his 84-hectare farm near Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire.The duo teamed up via a Welsh government-funded scheme which connects new farmers with landowners who are looking to step back.They are working hard on the environmental aspects of the business, Mr Jeffreys said, including diversifying the grass in their fields to include herbs and legumes to boost biodiversity and soil health.""I do worry for the future to be honest with you,"" he admitted.""I feel like the governments in this country aren't putting enough focus on food security and if we're not careful farmland will be blanket planted [with trees] and we'll be importing from overseas.""We'll think we're green and sustainable, but we won't be.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Welsh agriculture is dominated by sheep and cattle farmingFarming was the ""backbone of the rural economy"", agreed Mr Rickman, and severe job losses would be ""devastating"".Penri James, visiting lecturer in agriculture at Aberystwyth University, said there needed to be ""changes to the way farms operate"".He urged ""joined up thinking"" in government strategies around climate change, farming, skills and employment.""There should be a huge amount of concern in government about how this transition is going to operate because if they don't get it right there will be significant job losses in rural areas and the disappearance of viable businesses.""That would ""also have a socio-economic effect, in particular on the Welsh language,"" he said.A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said it welcomed the report, which it said highlighted why its plans to transform farm support payments were needed.  Its sustainable farming scheme, which comes in from 2025, would ""support our farmers in the sustainable production of food, at the same time as addressing the climate and nature emergencies,"" she said.The UK government said its plans for green jobs would ""ensure no workers are left behind"".""Far from a hands-off approach, we are investing nearly £4bn in supporting people retrain,"" a spokesman added.Related TopicsWalesAgricultureWelsh governmentClimate changeEnvironmentCarbon neutralityMore on this storyWhat does net zero mean?Published30 MarchNew UK plan to reach net zero goal faces criticismPublished30 MarchCould Welsh farms help hit climate change targets?Published21 October 2021View commentsTop Stories'My mother was missing, I got a picture of the body'Published9 hours agoModi vows punishments over deadly India rail crashPublished2 hours agoThree Israeli soldiers killed near Egypt borderPublished2 hours agoFeaturesIn pictures: Recovery operation after deadly crashThe stories at the heart of Prince Harry’s hacking claimMystery of spy deaths in Italian boat accidentDo Russians really hate the West?

The system will offer regional information and advice to the public and send guidance direct to NHS England, the government and healthcare professionals.Individuals can sign up to receive alerts directly here, and people can specify which region they would like to receive alerts for. There will be four alert colours, with green indicating no risk to health:yellow means the heat could affect the particularly vulnerable - over-65s and those with an underlying health conditionamber means the impact could affect the wider population and is likely to be felt across the whole health servicered means a significant risk to life even for healthy people and a severe impact across all sectors would be expectedDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at the UK Health Security Agency, said the alert system would play ""a vital role"".""Last year saw record high temperatures across England and evidence shows that heatwaves are likely to occur more often, be more intense and last longer in the years and decades ahead,"" he said.""It is important we are able to quantify the likely impacts of these heatwaves before they arrive to prevent illness and reduce the number of deaths.""Will Lang, from the Met Office, said the effects of human-induced climate change were already being felt on UK summers ""with an increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme heat events over recent decades"".The health alerts would help save lives, protect property and the economy ""as we all work to tackle adverse weather and climate change"", he said.Related TopicsMet OfficeClimate changeHeatwavesMore on this storyUK heatwave broke dozens of records, new data showsPublished14 October 20222022 was UK's warmest year on recordPublished5 JanuaryMet Office forecasts 2023 will be hotter than 2022Published20 December 2022A really simple guide to climate changePublished17 MarchView commentsTop Stories'My mother was missing, I got a picture of the body'Published9 hours agoModi vows punishments over deadly India rail crashPublished2 hours agoThree Israeli soldiers killed near Egypt borderPublished2 hours agoFeaturesIn pictures: Recovery operation after deadly crashThe stories at the heart of Prince Harry’s hacking claimMystery of spy deaths in Italian boat accidentDo Russians really hate the West?

And with climate change it's definitely going to affect that field of work and change how it operates,"" he said. ""I think it would be nice to learn about why it's happening and how my company can actually change it and benefit the world more.""The students have also learned about their own impact on the world by examining their carbon footprint.Discovering how climate change is affecting the planet has changed how these teenagers are living.  ""It just makes you want to try harder,"" said Courtney-Ann.  Image caption, Pupils learn about a range of issues around climate changeShe said: ""Because we do stuff in the house that we don't need.""We leave the heating on, we'll leave all lights on, we'd get long showers that we don't need and just all silly stuff like that, that you could just stop and cut down on and help out a lot. ""It's just the little things you could do to change a big part of the world.""The pupils are not the only ones learning new things. Teachers go on a one-day training with Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful.Geography teacher Chris Robb said: ""I learned stuff that I had read about at university, that had sort of been buried right down in the mind closet.""He said attitudes about climate change were evolving and the children were already working out ways to reduce their own impact. ""If that means that they make a tiny wee change, then perfect. And if that means our planet isn't going to warm up as quickly as it is now, fantastic,"" Mr Robb said. Image caption, The first cohort are now halfway through the courseThe pupils achieve a GCSE-equivalent grade B through coursework, without having to sit any exams.  ""I find that less stress-worthy,"" Mya said.  ""It's just easier, plus you get a good GCSE at the end. ""It's been very interesting and given me more awareness, so yeah, I say any child out there do it, because it's good for you.""More schools are expected to offer the course next year.

Demand for fuel made from animal by-products is expected to triple by 2030, with airlines leading the charge. But experts fear scarcity will force other industries to use more palm oil - a huge generator of carbon emissions.Airlines are under pressure to rein in their huge carbon emissions, which mainly come from burning fossil-based kerosene in aircraft engines.Government defends oil boss to head climate talksWhy is extreme weather killing fewer people?World likely to warm beyond key 1.5C limit by 2027But the study by Brussels-based Transport & Environment, a clean transport campaign group, points out there are simply not enough animals slaughtered each year to meet airlines' growing demand for animal fats.""There's not a never ending supply of animals, or animal fat,"" said Matt Finch from Transport & Environment. ""So if you put on a massive extra demand source from anywhere from aviation, in this case, the industries where fat is currently being used, will have to look for alternatives. And that alternative is palm oil. So aviation indirectly, will be responsible for increasing the amount of palm oil being pulled through the European systems.""The increased use of palm oil is linked to rising emissions as older forests which store vast amounts of carbon are cleared for new plantations. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Palm oil is made from these nuts and the concern is that other manufacturers might use more of this product if animal fats are used in aviationThe fact that animal fats are used as fuel will come as a surprise to many. For centuries tallow and lard have been used to make candles, soaps and cosmetics.However, over the last 20 years or so, biodiesel made from these animal wastes or from used cooking oils, has steadily grown in use in the UK and further afield. Across Europe, fuel made from dead animals has grown fortyfold since 2006, according to the new research.Much of this material is used in cars and trucks as biodiesel, which is classed as a sustainable fuel, and as such it has a much lower carbon footprint under the rules.But UK and EU governments are now very keen to increase the use of these types of waste to make aviation greener. To that end they are putting in place challenging mandates that will require airlines to use a bigger proportion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in their tanks. For the UK it's going to be 10% by 2030, for the EU 6% - but according to observers these plans could put pressure on the current market for animal waste.There are significant differences in approach between the UK and EU. The UK is likely to limit the use of better quality tallow in fuel - while in Europe the use of this type of material will be incentivised as the greenhouse gas reduction achieved with this fat is higher.With rising demand, prices will rise and this will likely encourage exports from the UK, which will have consequences. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Airlines are under pressure to reduce emissions caused by burning fossil fuelsHow many dead pigs do you need to fuel an airplane?According to Transport & Environment, a flight from Paris to New York would need fat from 8,800 dead pigs if all the fuel came from animal sources.With the UK likely to restrict the use of animal products and used cooking oils, flights that refuel across Britain will be likely to have only small amounts of animal-derived material in their engines.In the EU, airlines will have a 6% sustainable aviation fuel target for 2030 of which 1.2% must come from e-kerosene. Assuming the remaining 4.8% is derived entirely by animal fat, that would require around 400 pigs per transatlantic flight. Among those industries who might have to source different ingredients if aviation consumes a greater share of animal fat are pet food manufacturers.They currently utilise a significant amount of the better quality animal by-products to help feed the UK's 38 million pets. ""These are really valuable ingredients for us and they are hard to replace, and they're put to good use already in a very sustainable way,"" said Nicole Paley, deputy chief executive of UK Pet Food, the manufacturers' trade association.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Pet food manufacturers rely heavily on animal by-products""So actually diverting these ingredients to biofuels is actually creating another problem. It would put us in competition with the aviation industry. And when it comes to the purse strings of the aviation sector, the pet food industry would find it really difficult to compete.""While the EU is further down this road, the UK is currently consulting on limiting the type of animal fats that go into jet fuel.  The government is mulling a ban or a strict limit on both animal fats and used cooking oil in the aviation sector, worried about the unintended consequences. Many in the biofuel industry are concerned that the proposed changes might also see animal fats diverted from one form of transport to another. ""If you make a big incentive for use of these lipids, animal fats, and used cooking oils, in aviation, it will inevitably take it away from other things,"" said Dickon Posnett from Argent Energy, a waste-based biodiesel producer in the UK and Europe.""So if you want to increase aviation sustainability, at the expense of truck sustainability, then crack on. But that's a decision for the government to make.""Related TopicsCOP27Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeParis climate agreementClimate changeTop Stories'My mother was missing, I got a picture of the body'Published9 hours agoModi vows punishments over deadly India rail crashPublished2 hours agoThree Israeli soldiers killed near Egypt borderPublished2 hours agoFeaturesIn pictures: Recovery operation after deadly crashThe stories at the heart of Prince Harry’s hacking claimMystery of spy deaths in Italian boat accidentDo Russians really hate the West?

Premiership final: Protesters force stoppage of Twickenham showpiece between Saracens and SaleLast updated on 27 May 202327 May 2023.From the section Rugby UnionA Just Stop Oil protestor is escorted off the pitch after disrupting the Gallagher Premiership final between Saracens and Sale at TwickenhamJust Stop Oil protesters caused a stoppage to rugby's Gallagher Premiership final by running on to the pitch and throwing orange paint powder.The match between Sale and Saracens at Twickenham was briefly delayed when two men ran from the stands. Stewards escorted the protesters away to cheers from the crowd, and the men were later arrested.It was the latest sporting event to be affected after play was halted at the World Snooker Championship in April.A man climbed on to a table at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre and covered it in orange powder as another protester tried to glue herself to the second table. A 25-year-old man and 52-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage.A statement from Twickenham stadium said it was a ""police matter"", adding: ""We would like to thank our stewarding team who acted decisively and swiftly.""Just Stop Oil said the protesters at Twickenham were a doctor and a construction worker.A statement read: ""Today's action occurs against a back-drop of more extreme weather events, as increasingly greater carbon concentrations in the atmosphere push us closer to irreversible tipping points, threatening to spin the balance of humanities' life supports systems out of control.""Saracens won 35-25 to secure their sixth Premiership title and first in four years.Just Stop Oil: What is it and what does it want?Will they carve a brighter future down under?

Image source, PA MediaImage caption, The research recommended developers create more energy efficient homesAmong the recommendations is that there should be a single policy to cut emissions in the housing sector, which focuses on trying to incentivise developers, construction firms and homeowners to create more energy efficient homes. Other suggestions include retrofitting existing homes with low carbon heating systems, such as heat pumps, better insulation and a range of ""green"" mortgage products. According to David Little, chair of the Forum for a Better Housing Market NI, Northern Ireland is lagging behind the rest of the UK and Ireland.""Homes here record the lowest energy performance scores compared to our neighbours and we are not on track to meet UK net-zero targets,"" he said.The research carried out at Ulster University was led by Prof Martin Haran, who highlighted ""a series of failed initiatives allied with a non-sitting Stormont Executive has ensured that Northern Ireland lags behind other UK regions and the Republic of Ireland"".The report also points to how other UK nations are tackling the issue, such as in England and Wales, with ""the Heat and Buildings Strategy in 2023, pledging £3.9bn in new funding to decarbonize heat and buildings"".In 2021, the Welsh government announced it would build 20,000 low-carbon homes by 2026 while in Scotland new rules were introduced to ensure new houses use renewable or low-carbon heating.According to the report, Northern Ireland's Climate Change Bill in 2022 represented a significant milestone ""in terms of tackling climate change and decarbonisation"", as it puts Northern Ireland on a par with other UK regions by mandating 2030, 2040 and 2050 net zero targets.How will your house go carbon-free?The UK has some of the least energy-efficient housing in Europe - largely because much of the housing stock is so old. Northern Ireland homes are among the least efficient in the UK, making them among the least efficient in Europe.  Properties are rated on energy efficiency via an energy performance certificate (EPC), which rates the property from grade A - most efficient - to grade G.The government previously set a target to upgrade as many homes to grade C by 2035 ""where practical, cost-effective and affordable"".However, some campaigners have criticised the progress towards this goal. Many newer homes continue to be built without basic insulation. In 2022, the UK climate advisory group, UKCCC, warned the government that: ""We are still building new homes that do not meet minimum standards of efficiency.""Related TopicsHousingClimate changeNI economyRenewable energyMore on this storyNI 'needs radical action' to meet climate goalPublished2 MarchTop Stories'My mother was missing, I got a picture of the body'Published9 hours agoModi vows punishments over deadly India rail crashPublished2 hours agoThree Israeli soldiers killed near Egypt borderPublished2 hours agoFeaturesIn pictures: Recovery operation after deadly crashThe stories at the heart of Prince Harry’s hacking claimMystery of spy deaths in Italian boat accidentDo Russians really hate the West?

The UN has long been criticised for the involvement of the fossil fuel industry in the COP climate summits.On Thursday, Minister for Net Zero Graham Stuart said Jaber was ""an outstanding individual"".What was agreed at COP27?Why has an oil boss been chosen to head COP28?Every year the host country for the global climate summit, known as COP, nominates a president. As well as organising the event they provide political leadership, heading up critical negotiations on climate action in the run up to, and during, the conference.This year the hosts, the UAE, nominated Sultan Ahmed al Jaber, the head of the state oil company, as president of the summit, which starts in Dubai in November.Campaigners have been growing increasingly vocal against this decision, and this week 133 lawmakers from the EU and US joined the call for his removal. In a joint letter addressed to the United Nations, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden, the lawmakers expressed their ""profound concern"" that the fossil fuel industry was allowed to exert influence on the talks. But Mr Stuart, during a news conference on Thursday, defended the decision of the UAE. Speaking at an environmental technology conference, he said: ""I think he is an outstanding individual and we look forward to working with the UAE to ensure COP28 is a success and gets more countries committing to the necessary emissions reductions.""Mr Stuart also defended Jaber's track record at ADNOC, the UAE state oil company, saying that he was cleaning up their operations and reducing emissions.Any emissions from the production of oil are dwarfed by the emissions produced when it is used. But the emissions from using oil products like petrol are the responsibility of the country where they are used The UAE is one of the 10 largest oil producers in the world. Their state oil company pumped 2.7 million barrels of oil per day in 2021, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).The company aims to expand to nearly double output to five million barrels per day by 2027 - a target date brought forward from 2030 two months ago by Jaber.Zeina Khalil Hajj, head of global campaigning for 350.org, one of the groups calling for his removal, said: ""It is the equivalent of appointing the CEO of a cigarette company to oversee a conference on cancer cures.""In ten days countries will come together for the Bonn climate conference - the halfway point to COP28 which is used to reflect on progress in reaching climate targets. There are suggestions that these talks will be used to reflect on the involvement of polluting industries, like oil companies, in the talks.

How much disruption can a society handle? Do the rights of peaceful demonstrators outweigh the needs of ambulances, fire engines or commuters?   Those are the questions being fiercely debated in Germany on Thursday morning, after the homes of Last Generation environmental activists were raided by police early Wednesday. Last Generation's spokeswoman said about 25 police officers carrying guns stormed her bedroom while she was in bed, breaking down the door of her apartment in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg. ""We don't know what they were looking for,"" said one activist, ""we only have glue and high-vis jackets.""But that is enough to inflame a culture war that has the car parked right at its heart.The popular tabloid cliché portrays sausage-eating, car-driving German traditionalists being bossed around by moralistic young vegans. Mainstream Germany is, as ever, more nuanced. But the extremes on both sides appear to be getting more radical. Videos on social media regularly show angry drivers shouting at and sometimes attacking activists. It might seem surprising that the discussion over climate is so fierce in Germany.After all, this is a country with the Green Party in government, with effective recycling, widespread bike use and heavily subsidised public transport. The government not only has ambitious legally binding climate targets, but also, unlike the UK, concrete policies to reach them. But Germany is also a country with a powerful auto industry, where the car is often king. Debates over pedestrianising roads turn into tortuous political battles lasting years. The recent Berlin regional election was partly fought between a conservative campaign for more rights for drivers and Green demands for better bike paths. The conservatives won. Rows regularly blow up between two of the parties in Germany's three-way governing coalition: the Greens and the liberal pro-car pro-business FDP, which views driving a Porsche without a speed limit on the motorway as a fundamental liberal right. Both parties are struggling in the polls, making them even more desperate to fight for their ideological values. Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's contribution to the debate this week was to describe the actions of Last Generation as ""completely crazy"".Image source, PA MediaImage caption, In the UK, Just Stop Oil has been using similar tacticsThe same issues are being discussed in the UK. But the environmentalists disrupting transport to highlight the climate emergency are part of a different group; Just Stop Oil. The tactics of both groups are similar. Last Generation activists glue themselves to roads or vehicles to block traffic as a way of highlighting climate change. Over the past month, German activists have focused on Berlin: on Tuesday, at least five separate roads were blocked, as well as the main motorway around the city - twice.Both organisations also stage high-profile stunts involving artwork: Just Stop Oil protesters have thrown soup at Van Gogh's Sunflowers, while Last Generation activists threw mashed potatoes at a Monet painting. But their concrete demands are different. Just Stop Oil's targets are big-picture, including an end to fossil fuels and more renewable energy. Last Generation has specific aims which, compared to their radical actions, seem modest and technocratic: a 100 km/h speed limit on motorways; a €9 (£7.80) public transport monthly ticket; a citizens' council to plan how to scrap fossil fuels by 2030.Activists say they are offering concrete suggestions and want to talk to political leaders. In some German cities, mayors negotiate with Last Generation activists in return for an end to protests.But the big difference between the two countries is the legal and political environment. Germany's 20th-Century experience of Nazi and communist dictatorship means that the right to protest is sacrosanct. In the UK, two Just Stop Oil activists were jailed for up to three years for scaling the Dartford Crossing bridge and unfurling a banner, which then led to traffic delays. The British government's new Public Order Act gives police more powers to crack down on climate protests, with heavier penalties and actions that would not legally be possible in Germany.What is Just Stop Oil and what does it want?In Germany, activists who block roads typically receive fines. But in March, for the first time, Last Generation activists were handed a prison sentence which was not suspended. Two men received sentences of a few months for repeatedly gluing themselves to roads and blocking traffic. The sentence sparked outrage among civil rights campaigners. Wednesday's police raids have made the debate even more ferocious. On Thursday Conservative politicians and many newspaper commentators applauded Wednesday's police raids on activists. The Cologne daily, the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, called Last Generation's actions ""blackmail"" and said the activists should win people over, rather than punish them for the government's mistakes. Left-wing politicians and voters accuse the police of being heavy-handed. They say an organisation with the same aims as the government cannot be called criminal. ""Why are cannons being used to shoot sparrows?"" asks the Reutlinger General-Anzeiger. This week activists have been taking to the streets in protest, saying police actions will simply galvanise support. Critics meanwhile are demanding more powers for the police. Instead of calming tensions, the raids may make both sides more radical.

Rangers say this stream on the salt flats near Kowanyama grows bigger each year.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)""We used to just drive across here with a little two-wheel drive. In years to come I reckon this is going to turn into a big creek.""It's a worrying sign, which Mr Frank and other Indigenous rangers in this part of Cape York believe is evidence of climate change. Anzac Frank says the widening stream on the salt flats is impacting the community's way of life.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)A crisis of food and cultureFormer ranger John Clark, who has lived in Kowanyama most of his adult life, says the community has always relied on bush tucker and hunting for food.""Come round about September [or] early October, we generally go out into the dried-up swamps and put a bait net in for all the yabbies,"" he says.""But now we can't do that because every waterhole [is changing], since the climate's changing the weather pattern — the crocs are moving around.""While some watercourses are running full for longer, Mr Clark says others are drying up. John Clark started the town's Indigenous rangers program decades ago.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)Sitting in a dried section of Magnificent Creek, which runs alongside the town, he explains this would have been under water in previous decades.""I'd say in another 50 years' time this water is never going to be here,"" he says.'Powerful' eyes on the landThe Gulf of Carpentaria has had some of the highest yearly sea-level rises in Australia at about 8 millimetres a year, according to a 2022 State of the Climate report from the Bureau of Meteorology.Steve Turton, from Central Queensland University, says environmental and climate observations from rangers and elders on country provide vital information for researchers. Popular fishing spot Magnificent Creek was once known for flooding, but locals say large sections now dry out.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)""That's more powerful actually than any kind of Western science can ever provide,"" Professor Turton says.""If they're seeing changes that are detrimental to both nature and culture, then it's critically important that there is investment in both research and on country stewardship to make sure that these areas are able to survive climate change.""Professor Turton, and adjunct professor in environmental geography who has published numerous scientific reports and a textbook on climate change, says rising sea levels create a greater risk of inundation for coastal areas.He says the western Cape York region has recorded above-average rainfall for the past 20 years, which has impacted on the seasonal flow of river systems. Kowanyama means ""place of many waters"" and relies on multiple water bodies for food and culture.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)""Normally, rivers that are ephemeral or seasonal will flow for a longer season and have a shorter season with no flow or low flow,"" he says.""These kinds of events are going to become more common through this region, simply because there's going to be a higher stand of water.""It can go inland further when the conditions are suitable.""You'd expect areas that were freshwater systems to begin to transition to be brackish and eventually become saltwater systems."" Access to fishing and other bush tucker is integral to the diet and culture of many Kowanyama locals.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)Restricted access to burial siteKowanyama Aboriginal Shire Council Mayor Robbie Sands says climate change is ""real and happening in Kowanyama"".He said other watercourses in the region, which people could once cross have now become so deep, or waterlogged, they're impossible to pass.One creek near the town is rising perilously close to a sacred site, he says.""Some of our old people are buried there from way back before white man came to Kowanyama,"" Cr Sands says.""It's harder to access and protect those areas as well, so it is impacting our culture.""Cr Sands says the duration of seasons has also changed, affecting locals' day-to-day lives and diet.""Wet season is starting now in January, as opposed to November … dry seasons are becoming drier, because the wet seasons are shorter,"" he says. Robbie Sands says many elders have expressed concern to him about the changing landscape.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)Cr Sands, a First Nations man originally from the east coast, says elders from the Kowanyama area have reported similar observations.""They do say that the country is changing, the seasons are changing, and access to our bush tucker and hunting and gathering practices is changing as well,"" he says. Priscilla Major says the land needs to be treated with more respect.(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)As locals watch the changes, elders like Priscilla Major are worried.""This river here [Topsy Creek], we fish off it … although this river has lots of things which are Dreamtime totems too in the water there,"" she says.Mr Frank says locals used to drive across the mud flats but rising water has made it difficult, and at times impossible, to access fishing spots and other cultural areas, including burial sites.""It's going to damage the sacred sites … I don't know what's going to happen with them,"" Mr Frank says.""It's a piece of culture that's gone then.""He says the whole community used to come down to the salt flats but that's not possible, even in the dry, anymore.""It wasn't like this 10 years ago. I can see the changes here, now,"" Mr Frank says.Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted 21h ago21 hours agoFri 2 Jun 2023 at 11:50pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesAs islands are 'eaten away' Torres Strait leader fears only getting 'crumbs' after COP27 dealCrocs and people have shared these waterways for millennia, but one thing could alter that harmony foreverAboriginal people say there are six seasons, not four, and they're changingMore on:CairnsClimate ChangeEnvironmental ImpactFloodsIndigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander)KowanyamaMount IsaABC EmergencySearch any location in Australia to find nearby active incidentsFind an incidentStay up-to-dateStay up-to-date with local coverage on ABC Radio, the emergency broadcasterABC Radio FinderPlan for an emergencyPlan for a StormPlan for a FloodTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

It was then delayed to 2022. The Northern Territory government has missed two deadlines for releasing its emissions projection report. (Reuters: Angus Mordant)A spokesperson from the NT Environment Department confirmed a completed report was received and is currently being considered by the NT government, but could not provide any details on when the report would be made public.The Northern Territory and Western Australia are the only two jurisdictions in the country where carbon emissions are on the rise.Earlier this year the NT government gave the green light for fracking in the Beetaloo Basin, and its recently handed down budget forecasted a surplus that hinges on Santos' $4.7 billion Barossa gas field off the coast of the Tiwi Islands going ahead.Mr Bandt said the public had the right to know how much pollution was being put in the atmosphere.""Labor is hiding these reports because they know they will tell a very sorry tale that gas is pushing up Australia's climate pollution [and] pushing a safer climate out of reach,"" he said.""Decisions now to open new gas projects will put a safer climate out of reach for our kids and our grandkids.""NT Treasurer and Minister for Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics Eva Lawler said the fast-changing energy and climate space was a reason for the delay.""Things are changing very quickly in that space around emissions,"" the minister said.""We're talking about using carbon capture and storage in the Northern Territory and we're talking about offsets and we have the greenhouse gas emissions offset policy."" David Karoly was among 100 scientists to urge the NT government to abandon its fracking plans in the Beetaloo Basin.(ABC News: Michael Slezak)Professor David Karoly, an atmospheric scientist from the University of Melbourne, said the delay was inconsistent with other states and territories, which typically prepared emissions projections on a ""very regular"" basis.He said in the few years since the last report, scientists had observed a significant growth in emissions in the Northern Territory — by 13 per cent over the past 15 years.That observation is backed by data in the federal government's 2021 Greenhouse Gas Inventory showing the territory's emissions have grown from 12.4719 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2005 to 14.112 million tonnes in 2021.""I certainly expect that greenhouse gas emissions in the Northern Territory will increase significantly over the next 10 years if further fracking projects are continued,"" Professor Karoly said.Kirsty Howey, the director of the Environment Centre NT, said hopes of opening new gas fields like the Beetaloo Basin and the Barossa project being factored into a budget surplus forecast jarred with the government's commitments to net zero targets by 2050.""We need binding targets to reduce our emissions by certain dates but what we are seeing by the government are proposals to exponentially increase emissions and hurdle us towards climate collapse,"" Ms Howey said.The Northern Territory government is hoping to mitigate carbon emissions at its proposed Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct at Darwin Harbour through carbon capture and storage technologies.But Professor Karoly — who is a councillor at Climate Council Australia and who was among the 100 scientists to call on the government to abandon its fracking plans in the Beetaloo Basin — said research showed there was ""no way to stop the leakage of emissions"". The NT government has tasked experts to analyse projected emissions in the Territory but according to their website have missed the 2021 and 2022 deadlines. (NT government website)Posted 31 May 202331 May 2023Wed 31 May 2023 at 9:32pm, updated 31 May 202331 May 2023Wed 31 May 2023 at 11:19pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesFracking in the Beetaloo Basin will go ahead.

Victoria's 2014 snow season was coined the ""snowmageddon"".(Supplied: David Vincent)The BoM have also noted two of the best seasons on record – 1956 and 1981 – had no snow at all at the start of June.However, there seems to be general agreement among meteorologists, including ABC Meteorologist Tom Saunders, that icy offerings from the sky will be pretty lean on the ground this season.Why is there less snow?The main drivers of a winter wonderland are strong cold fronts.Or plenty of weaker ones to keep the snow coming. The best seasons have had plenty of systems pushing across southern Australia.Unfortunately, the current climate set up isn't conducive to that.El NiñoHow would a potential 'extreme' El Niño climate pattern affect Australia?All climate models say an El Nio will happen, but there is still no guarantee. So when will we know?Read moreThere's a likelihood that we're heading into an El Niño phase in Australia, which usually means less rain and snow in the eastern states.Weatherzone, which analysed nearly 70 years of snow depth data at Spencers Creek in NSW, found the average depth drops by 36 per cent at that site in an El Niño year.A BoM study found it was about 23 per cent lower overall under El Niño.Whether El Niño will happen is uncertain.The latest update from the BoM says the Pacific Ocean is neither El Niño or La Niño positive.But it has declared an El Niño watch, suggesting that there's double the usual chance that El Niño will be declared sometime this year.Positive IODThe Indian Ocean dipole is another climate driver. In a positive phase, it means less cloudiness over Australia's north west.That's where tropical moisture can flow from and feed down to the south east, usually in conjunction with cold fronts and troughs crossing the south.What is the Indian Ocean Dipole ?For many places across the east coast, spring won't bring an end to the rain and the cold.Read moreYou may have heard of the north-west cloud bands. So generally, it means less rainfall over southern Australia.Right now, the IOD is neutral. But the BoM, analysing five different climate models, believes that a positive IOD is coming this winter.It also cautions that ""long range forecasts of IOD made at this time of the year have generally had low accuracy"".The worst outcome for the snow season would be an El Niño phase and positive IOD.Positive SAMThe third, and possibly most important climate driver, is the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).It's all about how far north or south the westerly winds that blow around the southern hemisphere move closer to or further away from the Antarctic.The closer they are to southern Australia, the more likely that cold fronts will be able to ride along them, move north and affect rainfall over the nation's south.Unfortunately, the phase of the SAM (positive, neutral or negative) changes every couple of weeks.And that makes it difficult to predict snow more than 10 days ahead because of the reliance on cold fronts.Is it all bad news?Not all is lost … there's snowmaking!It's especially important given Australia's fickle ski seasons.In 2006, people were often skiing on grass, and the World Cup event at Mount Buller had to be cancelled following the worst snowfalls in 33 years. Man-made snow usually only covers beginner and low-intermediate slopes.(Supplied: David Vincent)But in 2014, there was so much of the white stuff it was labelled ""snowmageddon"".Snowmaking began in Thredbo in the mid 80s. The man-made snow generally covers only beginner areas and low-intermediate slopes.In seasons where there is less cloud to trap in the heat at night, there are lower minimum temperatures.It's a case of clear skies, frosty nights and dry air as well, which allows water droplets from the snow-making cannons to freeze more quickly. Winter rain can wash away natural or artificial snow.(Supplied: David Vincent)These are the ingredients for good snowmaking and can mean less snow melt.Another issue is that winter rain can wash away the snow on the ground, whether natural or artificial.So even though there might be more snow in a La Niño year, the likelihood of extra rain could wipe out that advantage.What about the future?Australia experiences a huge variability in the snow depth from year to year and unfortunately, there's  a downward trend. The depth of snow at Rocky Valley Dam in Falls Creek has been declining over the past few decades.(Supplied: CSIRO)A CSIRO and Australian National University (ANU) report in 2003, updated in 2012, stated that the land area with at least 60 days of natural snow cover would shrink by 38 to 96 per cent by 2050.And that would make some of the ski fields at lower elevations more marginal.The report continued that ""snow measurements at Victoria's Rocky Valley Dam [in Falls Creek] from 1954 to 2011 indicate a clear trend to lower maximum snow depths and an earlier end of the snow season"".""The earlier end of the snow season is clearly dependent on changes in temperature,"" the report said.The bottom lineSnow seasons are notoriously difficult to predict.And many meteorologists have been caught out predicting bumper seasons that fail to materialise.But the indicators are that we're in for a leaner-than-usual season, with lower natural snow depths and possibly an earlier end to the season.Posted 31 May 202331 May 2023Wed 31 May 2023 at 9:17pm, updated 1 Jun 20231 Jun 2023Thu 1 Jun 2023 at 12:04amShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesEl Niño forecasting a hard task during unpredictable autumn, climate scientists sayThere's a new weather event underway, and it will bring with it more rain for Australia's east coastMore on:Alpine SkiingClimate ChangeFalls CreekMelbourneMount BullerMount HothamSnow BoardingSnowfallWeather PhenomenaTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

That's estimated to cause around 4.2 million deaths each year. Aerosols can be reduced by limiting fossil fuels, deforestation, and overgrazing. (Image: Reuters/Truth Leem)Phosphorus One of Morocco's biggest areas of phosphate reserves at Khouribga, where the rock phosphate goes straight to port.(Rob Napier)There are at least two big dangers of excessive fertiliser use: eutrophication from using too much, and running out.Phosphorus is essential to life, and intensive agriculture depletes the soil of phosphorus, which then needs to be replenished with fertiliser.But the phosphorus we use in inorganic fertiliser is a finite resource mined mostly from phosphate rock.There are some indications that we've already reached peak supply — after which production will decline.Declining phosphorus supply may have serious implications for feeding people, said Charles Warren, who researches plant physiology and soil biogeochemistry at the University of Sydney.""As the availability of phosphorus goes down, of course the price will go up, and that becomes an issue of equity, because it'll be the poorer nations that will suffer the most,"" said Dr Warren, who was not involved in the research.""The areas of the globe with the most phosphorus-deficient soils are often those poorer nations. It's the tropics and the subtropics.""In terms of eutrophication, we are exceeding the planetary boundary for excess phosphorus use as a fertiliser, though not to the same extent as nitrogen.""(Image: ABC Rural/Rob Napier)Nitrogen Excessive nitrogen from fertiliser, but also from wastewater, can cause algal blooms.(Getty Images: Li Ziheng/Xinhua)Nitrogen is easier to replenish than phosphorus, however the nitrogen used in fertiliser is made from fossil fuels. In the soil it is partially converted to nitrous oxide — a potent greenhouse gas. Too much nitrogen fertilisation also causes eutrophication, where runoff into waterways leads to algal blooms and oxygen depletion.These can cause fisheries and ecosystem collapse, and drinking water contamination.On local scales, there are some instances where there is room for more nitrogen use, not less.But on a global scale, we're using far in excess of the safe (and just) limit.While there is room for some excess use without causing eutrophication, we're breaching that by more than 60 million tonnes annually, worldwide. (Image: Getty Images/Li Ziheng)Groundwater The Glenroy Bore is a hot water artesian bore, ideal for a soak, located on a farm 40km from Moree, in NSW.(ABC Open contributor haworthdavid)""Unsafe"" levels of groundwater extraction happen where the rate of water being harvested is higher than the rate an aquifer is recharged.This can cause reduced stream and lake levels, wetland loss, biodiversity loss, reduced water quality, land subsidence, and also intergenerational water shortages.For instance, research from 2021 found that Iran was facing ""a state of water bankruptcy"". Having doubled its rate of groundwater extraction in a few years, the country has widespread aquifer depletion and salinisation.The authors of that paper said their findings pointed to ""dire, worsening water security risks across the country"".Groundwater is a major source of income and drinking water for many countries.In the United States, around half the population relies on groundwater for drinking, and in many parts of Australia, groundwater is the primary water source for agriculture.Aquifers are replenished at different rates depending on location, but some may take tens of thousands of years, and so rates of extraction need to be regionally specific.Water levels in 47 per cent of groundwater basins globally are declining, according to today's report. Where depleted aquifers have ""already caused significant environmental impacts"", the authors recommend the urgent reduction of extraction and protection of catchments.(Image: ABC Open/haworthdavid)Surface water Hundreds of dead fish line the banks of the Newtown Dam.(ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Andrew Chounding)Research shows that altering river flow has significant impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function, according to report co-author Stuart Bunn from Griffith University's Australian Rivers Institute.""Our definition of safe is to actually protect freshwater ecosystems not just for their biodiversity but also acknowledging the essential services that freshwater ecosystems provide,"" Professor Bunn said.""Once we start altering flow regimes by more than 20 per cent we start to see significant impacts to freshwater systems and those services.""According to today's report, 34 per cent of global land area is exceeding this flow regime threshold. In other words, we're breaching this boundary for some, but not the majority of land surface.However, more than half the world's population relies on waterways with altered flows beyond the safe boundary.(Image: ABC Goldfields-Esperance/Andrew Chounding)Intact ecosystems Rainforest stretches to the horizon in the Sepik river basin.(Foreign Correspondent: Natalie Whiting)Ecosystem services are the invaluable functions of the natural world that make the planet habitable.Oxygen, biodiversity, cooling, water filtration, storm and flood buffering, medicine, and food are all products of ecosystem services. It is possible for ecosystems to remain ""intact"" and provide these services even if they are modified by humans.The authors have determined that 50 to 60 per cent of the Earth's surface needs to be intact.Currently we're at about 45 –50 per cent, said study co-author David Obura of marine conservation organisation CORDIO East Africa.""So we're just below or at that natural ecosystem area boundary.""(Image: ABC Foreign Correspondent/Natalie Whiting)Modified ecosystems The area covered by the coal exploration proposal is predominantly farmland.(ABC Central West: Hugh Hogan)Given the huge area of the Earth's surface we occupy, modified ecosystems are still necessary for the overall health of the planet. Having access to nature within modified systems is also considered important for human physical and mental health.The report recommends that all modified habitat needs to be interspersed with around 25 per cent natural vegetation, CORDIO's Mr Obura said. ""It has to be high-function to provide services to people,"" he said.  ""What we've determined is that about 50 per cent of [current] land area meets this earth system boundary, and half is below that boundary."" (Image: ABC Central West/Hugh Hogan)1C warming With more warming comes increased severity of extreme climate events like drought.(Getty Images: visionandimagination.com )One degree Celsius of warming is considered the ""just boundary"".But we are now at around 1.2C of warming on average above pre-industrial levels.Beyond 1C we're already experiencing impacts from more extreme weather events, which disproportionately impact poorer regions, according to Professor Rockstrom.""[This is] scientific evidence of the need for collective action on decarbonising the world economy as fast as we can.""Professor Gupta said a 1C target was significantly more ""just"" than 1.5C.""What we are trying to show through our paper is that even at 1C, there is a huge amount of damage taking place where tens of millions of people are exposed, for example, to temperature extremes.""This will only get worse and worse as we move into 1.5 and 2C.""(Image: Getty Images/visionandimagination.com)1.5C warming Runoff from Icecap - stock photo Waterfalls cascade to the sea from melting icecap(Getty Images: Stone)The boundary for safe warming is set at 1.5C, and is not yet breached.However, the World Meteorological Organisation now predicts that there is a 66 per cent chance the world will have at least one year above 1.5C average warming within the next five years. Warming of 1.5C poses significant risks and greatly increases the likelihood of hitting tipping points that lead to irreversible change on a global scale, Professor Rockstrom said.""Five of the 16 known climate tipping [points] are likely to be transgressed at 1.5C.""These include the collapse of the Greenland ice cap, rapid melting of permafrost, and collapse of a climate-altering current in the north Atlantic.""That's a safety limit which in itself is not well understood in the world, that 1.5C is a dangerous point.""(Image: Getty Images/Stone)Posted 31 May 202331 May 2023Wed 31 May 2023 at 8:00pm, updated Yesterday at 6:52amFri 2 Jun 2023 at 6:52amShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesKey ingredient of cattle feed supplements set to be mined locallyA stutter in Earth's icy heartbeat has 'gravely concerned' scientists searching for answersMore on:Air PollutionAustraliaClimate ChangeEnvironmentLand ManagementScience and TechnologyWaterTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

It's hoped the renewable energy boom will see the population grow permanently in small towns such as Prairie.(ABC North Queensland: Baz Ruddick)Stage 1 of the hub is a combination of wind, battery, and solar farms to be built in the Flinders Shire.Once complete, it will have a combined capacity of 2 gigawatts — enough energy to power one million homes.Nathan Blundell, general manager of development at Windlab, one of the companies tasked with building the first stage of the super hub said the region had a capacity factor of more than 60 per cent — one of the highest in the country.""That means you're getting power generation 60 per cent of the time, which is quite high,"" he said.""It's windy at night-time … it's windy when everywhere else in the country isn't windy.""That correlation with other areas of the nation actually means it's really crucial not just for Queensland, but for the entire National Electricity Market to decarbonise."" General manager of development at Wind Lab, Nathan Blundell.(ABC North Queensland: Baz Ruddick)'A massive project'The super hub will rely on a 1,000-kilometre transmission line which will stretch from Mount Isa to the east coast, connecting the north west to the national electricity grid for the first time.Director of operations Colin Langton said CopperString 2032 — formerly known as CopperString 2.0 — is the largest network project currently in Australia.""This will be a big step in the right direction,"" he said.Part of the transmission line, between Townsville and Hughenden will carry 500,000 volts (500kV).""500kV is the highest voltage that we have in Australia,"" Mr Langton said.""There's a lot of that in the southern states, but it'd be the first time that we've had 500 KV in Queensland.""It's a massive project … just the scale will bring some real challenges."" The Queensland government says it will invest $5 billion in CopperString 2032.(Supplied: CopperString 2.0)He says one of the main challenges will be sourcing the 800 workers needed for the construction phase of the transmission line.""We're really focusing on opportunities for locals and that's all the way out to Mount Isa from Townsville and the Burdekin area,"" he said.""We're going to have a training school in Townsville, and Powerlink has just started a training school in Gladstone so there'll be local training opportunities.""[But] we will need to supplement [the workforce] with some overseas workers as well, just because of the size and scale of this project, and all the other projects that are going on in Australia at the same time."" Publicly owned company Powerlink is leading the CopperString 2032 project.(ABC News: Craig Andrews)'Daunting' shortage of skilled workersThe Clean Energy Council said Australia's skills shortage across the clean energy sector is ""threatening"" the roll out of projects around the country.Director of Workforce Development, Anita Talberg said Australia's skilled workforce would need to double over the next five to seven years as a ""conservative estimate"".""Depending on whether we are considering a large export market, for example for green hydrogen, we may need up to 250,000 to 400,000 workers over the next 15 years,"" Dr Talberg said.""Those numbers are quite eye-watering and a bit daunting. It's a real challenge."" Dr Anita Talberg says Australia will have to source thousands of overseas workers in coming years to fill the skilled workers shortage.(ABC News: Barrie Pullen)Dr Talberg said the gap will ultimately need to be filled by international expertise.""Ideally, we'd love to have a homegrown workforce. The reality is that's probably not going to make the cut,"" she said.""Particularly in areas where we don't have a lot of that skill set already in Australia, we're going to need to draw on that global talent.""I think it can be done; we just need to make sure that we're starting that work now.""The 'land of opportunity'Sam Fryer lives on a property between Hughenden and Prairie with his young family.He says while the region is ""at full capacity"" he is keen to see the north west make the most of the renewable energy boom. Sam Fryer lives on a property 20 kilometres outside of Hughenden in north-west Queensland.(Supplied)""There is a shortage of accommodation … we're lacking workforce right now in regional Queensland.""Our infrastructure currently — whether you're looking at the hospital, schools, roads, or the housing — needs to be upgraded to accommodate for that larger population coming in.""""It's a land of opportunity it just needs a bit of help to get there.""He said projects such as the Super Hub and CoppperString have the potential to create long-term benefits for places like Hughenden, Mount Isa and surrounding areas.""It'd be great to somehow ensure that there's a long-term benefit of this in the towns, not just a short-term boom, with these workers coming through in an influx."" Renewable energy projects will have a significant impact on small towns like Prairie in north-west Queensland.(ABC News: Baz Ruddick)Flinders Shire Council Mayor Jane McNamara hopes the projects will recharge the region's population permanently.""Our goal is to have 3,000 people back in the Shire … I see a very bright future ahead.""But Cr NcNamara said there were obstacles to overcome first.She said her first hurdle in supporting stage 1 of the project was water security.""Desperately we will need more water,"" Cr McNamara said.""The bore that is servicing Prairie at the moment is about 80 years old. It's just coping with the population that's there now.""Cr McNamara said the Flinders Highway was ""one of the worst roads in Queensland"".""It has real ruts where the transports are starting to get into it.

Four of the lowest minimum extents in the satellite era have now been recorded since 2016.The 2022 minimum extent marked the first time the extent had dropped below 2 million square kilometres.In February this year, it hit yet another all time low of just 1.79 million square kilometres.The extent is now reforming as the continent moves into the austral winter, but it's currently the smallest it has ever been for this time of year on record.This blip in the Antarctic pulse is being watched carefully by scientists, keen to understand whether the change is a mere natural fluctuation or part of a longer-term trend being driven by climate change.Phillip Reid's last trip to Antarctica was almost 30 years ago, but he can still picture the vast walls of steam pouring from cracks in the sea ice.A spectacular and unusual interaction between the ocean, atmosphere and the ephemeral barrier between them: the sea ice.Dr Reid, an Antarctic research scientist with the Bureau of Meteorology, had travelled to Antarctica in the winter time on the icebreaker Aurora Australis to study this very reaction.When ocean surface temperatures are warmer than the air above, it can generate mist that rises from the ocean. Phillip Reid travelled to Antarctica in the 1990s to study this reaction known as water vapour flux — a mist created when the air is cooler than the ocean temperatures.(Supplied: Phillip Reid) Phillip Reid's research team investigated the interaction of the ocean, atmosphere and the sea ice during an expedition to Antarctica in the 1990s.(Supplied: Phillip Reid)It is called water vapour flux and it is one of many variables, in a complex web, that stand to be affected by variations in Antarctic sea ice.The smaller the sea ice extent, the more the ocean is exposed, meaning more steam can be generated. This means there's more moisture in the atmosphere, which can eventually turn into rain.""So overall, we would expect that if there was a reduction in the sea ice, that Australia, particularly south eastern Australia, would see more rainfall that's based on the current research,"" Dr Reid said. ""But not only rainfall, we would see some warmer temperatures during September and possibly cooler temperatures during the winter periods.""Most people will never set foot on sea ice, or even come close enough to see it. But changes to the sea ice can be felt far beyond the shores of Antarctica.Not only does the sea ice play a vital role in local and regional weather patterns, it's an essential component in driving powerful ocean currents, it fuels marine biodiversity, and can help regulate global climate.Above the water, the ice provides an important breeding and feeding ground for populations of penguins and seals. Underneath, it's a habitat for an array of marine life.The melting of ice in spring releases microscopic nutrients into the water — a crucial link in the food chain of the Southern Ocean.It also acts as an important barrier between the sun and the ocean. White sea ice can reflect incoming heat from the sun; in its absence, the solar radiation is absorbed by the dark ocean, which can in turn warm the seas.Dr Reid co-authored a study that modelled the impact of ice free coastlines. It found increased exposure to long-period swells could cause the disintegration of ice shelves — the floating extension of Antarctic ice sheets.Data shows areas of the Amundsen and Bellinghausen seas, in west Antarctica, are already being exposed to the open ocean more often in Summer months.""So that means that potentially those ice shelves that are around western Antarctica become more vulnerable to ocean processes such as long period swells, which means that, under certain conditions, they can disintegrate,"" Dr Reid said. ""Which means that the ice sheets behind them may go into the ocean, so it has implications for sea-level rise.""For all these reasons and more, scientists keep a watchful eye on the health of Antarctic sea ice.Despite the recent record-shattering figures, Antarctic experts like Ted Scambos are hesitant to say whether the last seven years represent a long term downward trend in the sea ice extent, and if it is being driven by climate change.The hesitation is in part due to the relatively short record scientists have of the sea ice extent.Satellites have only been used to monitor the ice since 1978 and, in that time, the story of Antarctic sea ice has been one of extreme variability.""So, folks are hesitant to say if the six- or seven-year trend that we've seen is the beginning of something longer term and connected directly to global climate change,"" Dr Scambos said.It could take several more years of sea ice decline to be more confident of linking the changes to climate change, Dr Scambos said. Sea ice largely melts away during Antarctica's warmer months.(EU: Sentinel 2)Prior to the record breaking lows of 2016, Antarctica notched up its largest sea ice extents of the satellite era in 2013 and 2014.The 2014 maximum was more than 1.5 million square kilometres larger than the 1981-2010 average extent and marked the first time on record that the sea ice exceeded 20 million square kilometres.Petra Heil, a sea ice physicist with the Australian Antarctic Division, believes this variability of extreme highs and lows is a sign of a system imbalance.She is more confident of the link between climate change and the changes to the sea ice over the last year.""I'm pretty much convinced it will be, over the long term, a downward trend because we are going through a stage of high instability,"" Dr Heil said. ""We will lose more and more sea ice from year to year and the net downward trend will continue.""""I'm concerned. I'm gravely concerned.""In the northern hemisphere, the impact of climate change on the Arctic ice extent is more established.Since the mid-80s, the Arctic has been warming twice as fast as the entire world — a phenomenon the vast majority of scientists agree is the direct result of human-induced climate change.Temperature increases in the Arctic have consistently been two, sometimes three times as high as the rest of the globe. This is known as ""polar amplification"".The more the Earth warms, the more the sea ice shrinks.But unlike the Arctic, the influence of climate change on Antarctic sea ice is not as clear cut.Sea ice changes in the Arctic have occurred in every region, all year round. In the Southern Ocean, the sea ice surrounding the coastline, which stretches for thousands of kilometres, has been subject to high levels of regional variability, making it harder to spot continent-wide trends.Dr Scambos and Dr Heil agree that to better understand what is happening, more research is critical.In August, an expedition of around 60 scientists was due to travel into the East Antarctica Marginal Ice Zone aboard Australia's new $500 million research vessel, RSV Nuyina. A critical expedition to study Antarctic sea ice had to be cancelled because of troubles with RSV Nuyina.(ABC News: Henry Belot)The purpose of the trip was to study the interaction of sea ice, atmosphere, ocean and ecosystems and how that impacts climate.But the expedition, which would have been the first cross-disciplinary voyage of its kind in more than a decade, was cancelled because of ongoing issues with Nuyina.Dr Heil, who is the chief investigator on the marginal ice zone study, is now working on alternative research options.She said that while satellite observations and simulation data had provided invaluable information, field work in Antarctica was urgently needed.""It's such a strongly coupled system, if there is a small change somewhere, it often has many follow-on effects,"" she said. ""If the system is stable, a small disturbance doesn't really matter. But at the moment, the climate system is out of balance, so any noise will actually amplify that.""For us to understand all the different signals and noise and how they combine is very important, and so, scientific observations are invaluable to have, and we need to intensify observations now rather than in a few years.""CreditsReporting: Mark DomanDevelopment: Katia ShatobaDesign: Alex PalmerNotes about data used in this story:The sea ice extent and long term median spatial data was sourced from the National Snow and Ice Data Center's sea ice index.Posted 30 May 202330 May 2023Tue 30 May 2023 at 8:02pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterMore on:AntarcticaClimate ChangeEarth SciencesGlobal WarmingOceans and ReefsTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

Nick Frederiksen is leasing out EV vehicles.(ABC Central Victoria: Tyrone Dalton)""In my mind, it's not a green thing, it's at least for the business side of things, a more capitalistic view and so the numbers make more sense,"" Mr Frederiksen says.""From a money point of view, I'll pay less to get a car that will last longer, as in up to 1 million kilometres. So that's 3,000 cycles of the battery on those ones.""So, 110,000 kilometres a year is totally fine. For a normal, internal combustion car, maybe three or four years of doing that and it's near the end of life. But with this, it's only a third of its life.""With another Model Y on the way, Mr Frederiksen sees himself at the start of the adoption curve where he can capitalise on popular electric vehicles as they get cheaper, and advances are made in technology to build up an autonomous taxi fleet.

Rob Rendell uses several apps to decide when to charge his Tesla Model Y.(ABC Central Victoria: Tyrone Dalton)""I'm very interested in this sort of thing. The average person just wants to set and forget [and leave their car to charge at little cost], and we're not quite there yet,"" he says.""I've got four apps to control it. We should only have one, but I think in 12 months' time that'll we'll only have one.""There are times when I used to put my power back in [to the grid]. Now, there's another app that will stop the energy going in when it's negative [pricing]."" Looking at getting an electric vehicleMeanwhile, Craig Kingsley is weighing up whether to get an electric vehicle or buy a Mazda2.""I've had this one (car) about 15 years. Use it pretty strictly for commuting. So doesn't have a lot of kilometres on it and runs perfectly, but it's an old car without a lot of the new tech on it. So I don't need one, but I would like one,"" he says. Craig Kingsley is questioning the cost of buying an EV over a combustion engine car. (ABC Central Victoria: Tyrone Dalton)As a daily-run commuter, the 15-year-old Mazda2 has less than 100,000 kilometres, leaving Mr Kingsley to think he, as someone who doesn't have to worry about range anxiety, is the ideal candidate for an electric vehicle.Expect more EVs on the road under new electric vehicle strategyYou can expect many more EVs on the road in the coming years if the government imposes carbon emission caps on car makers. But how many more people will buy EVs, and will they be cheaper?Read more""I've been looking into some of the smaller and newer electric cars that will be around 400 kilometres of range and around $50,000, give or take a couple of grand,"" he says.""As opposed to a petrol car, a Mazda2 or Kia Picanto are around about $20,000 and $25,000.""So, if I get an electric vehicle, I will not make the extra money spent back. I don't see that ever happening in lower operating costs or lower fuelling costs.""It'll be strictly a matter of getting ahead of the curve and patting myself on the back for doing something environmentally aware.""Change is happeningThe federal government released its EV strategy in April spelling out proposed fuel efficiency standards for light vehicles.And last November, parliament passed the $345 million Electric Car Discount Bill which exempts eligible electric cars for business from fringe benefits tax and the removal of the 5 per cent import tariff for families. Most electric vehicle chargers across Australia's public charging network come with two types of connectors.(ABC Central Victoria: Tyrone Dalton)Meanwhile, more EV charging stations are popping up around the country.Online app for EV users, PlugShare, shows there are 712 EV chargers across Australia.The Central Victorian Greenhouse Alliance has played a role in the rollout of 23 electric vehicle chargers across the Loddon Mallee region in Victoria. Dr David Gormley-O'Brien says people need to look at how often, and far, they drive to weigh up the cost benefits of EVs.(ABC Central Victoria: Tyrone Dalton)Its programs director David Gormley-O'Brien says the cost benefit of an EV ""really depends on the number of kilometres that you drive"".""If you drive a lot of kilometres then it makes really good financial sense to go to an electric vehicle because with the fuel savings that you make — especially if you've got solar at home, but even if you're just charging from the grid — it's going to be much more economic quite early with that,"" he says.""If you're only travelling a small, small range, and it takes a lot longer to become economically viable to get to the intersection.""Dr Gormley-O'Brien says there are more than 450 public electric vehicle charging stations in Victoria and that the alliance is working with local government to develop a policy and strategy for more chargers.Local news direct to your inboxABC Central Victoria will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

(Images: MehmetUysal14/Bayram Çini)After watching Akşehir slowing dry up for years, Mr Çini was horrified on his most recent visit to find nothing but a huge plane of cracked earth scattered with dead birds.And it's not the only one. Mr Çini said four of the great tectonic lakes of this vast region known as Türkiye's Lake District have dried up and four more have receded to critically low levels.In a study published in the journal Science last week, a team of international researchers reported that more than half of the world's large lakes and reservoirs had shrunk since the early 1990s due to climate change, unregulated water use and dam construction. The remains of flamingos are scattered across the region.(Reuters: Stringer )The report, which used satellite measurements combined with climate and hydrological models, found ""significant drying trends"" in 53 per cent of the world's natural lakes.It said unsustainable human use and rising temperatures had driven lake levels down, resulting in the loss of billions of tons of water.In Türkiye, which is almost entirely covered by three of the world's critical biodiversity hotspots, experts say water loss is effecting endemic species, and impacting migratory bird numbers on a harrowing scale. Biodiversity hotspots are the most biologically rich regions on earth.(Supplied: CEPF)Across the country over the past 50 years, dozens of lakes as well as around 1.5 million hectares of wetland have dried up, sometimes taking entire species along with them, said Dr Çağan H Şekercioğlu, a Turkish professor of ecology, ornithology and conservation biology.""A lot of species are going extinct, especially Turkey’s endemic freshwater fish, and people don't even notice,"" he told the ABC, using Türkiye's previous English name which was officially changed last year.""They just die quietly — gone forever — and there's nobody to mourn them."" Türkiye's waterways were home to hundreds of unique fish species.(Reuters: Umit Bektas)Last year, Dr Şekercioğlu said he travelled to the Lake District to film a documentary about a species of fish that was endemic to one particular lake.Instead of a lake, they found ""a field covered in concrete, rubble and garbage"".""Here's a lake with an endemic fish species — gone! And these fish are now extinct from the planet and we're the first people to notice it,"" he recalled. For Dr Şekercioğlu, seeing the wetlands from his childhood drained and developed inspired a career dedicated to conservation.(Supplied: Çağan H Şekercioğlu)Of the 96 countries where he has worked, he said the state of Türkiye's wetlands ""are by far the worst"", and while it's ""fashionable to blame climate change"", the main culprit is actually unsustainable water use and draining for agriculture and development.""Climate change often just delivers the last blow.""YouTube Report: Half of the world's large lakes have shrunk since 1990sTürkiye's Lake District turning to dustBack at Lake Akşehir, Mr Çini explained that for months birds that once lived or migrated there have been dying off as the waters receded.When he first saw scores of dead young mallard ducks in December, he said ""he couldn't breathe"". Bayram Çini says watching Lake Akşehir slowly dry has been heartbreaking.(Supplied: Bayram Çini)""Seeing thousands of mallards dead really affected me deeply,"" he said.""Believe me, I forgot my humanity in front of that scene. It was unfair to these souls,"" he said, explaining that the lake was dried by human hands, but nature was paying the ultimate price.Mr Çini began an investigation into the cause of the deaths with the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, but no toxic or chemical substances were found. Today, the area that was Lake Akşehir is littered with dead birds.(Supplied: Bayram Çini)He believes, being the end of the breeding season, the young ducks could not fly well enough yet to make it to nearby Lake Eber, which has also severely receded.Mr Çini said illegal damming of streams and unregulated use of underground water supplies for agriculture was fast pushing the area towards ""desertification"".""For 10,000 years, the lake and the fertile land surrounding it gave us life, but we did not understand it,"" he said.""Dams are built on every stream bed and we dump our waste into this area.""Before: After: Use left and right arrow keys to control image transitionHover to reveal hidden imageTouch and move to reveal hidden image Lake Akşehir when Mr Çini first visited the area in 1995. / Lake Akşehir now. (Images: Bayram Çini/Google Earth)But locals say small dams and irrigation are vital for their farmlands, while more than 700 hydro-electric facilities — some of which have flooded villages and natural habits while drying up lakes and river downstream — generate about 17 per cent of Turkey’s electricity.For 30 years, Mr Çini and others have advocated for change, but have instead witnessed the slow death of their beloved lakes, and now much of the plant and animal life of the region is ""on the verge of extinction"". ""This world is not just ours, it is their home too … but we destroy it with our own hands.""Türkiye's 'damming craze' reaches the 'wild east'On the other side of Türkiye, Dr Şekercioğlu and his small team of workers and volunteers are fighting to save Lake Kuyucuk from the same fate.Dr Şekercioğlu grew up in the suburbs of Istanbul, playing in the wetlands nearby and dreaming of becoming a zoologist.While growing up, he saw those wetlands drained and developed, and that loss inspired a lifetime dedicated to conservation. Mr Şekercioğlu says he was shocked to see a ""huge human impact"" even in Türkiye's ""wild east"".(Supplied: Çağan H Şekercioğlu)The now 47-year-old went on to study biology, ecology and ornithology at Harvard and then Stanford before returning for a research project on butterflies in Türkiye's ""untamed and wild east"".""I always thought of the eastern part of the country like 'Turkey's Alaska'"", he said, but even in this remote region, he discovered a ""huge human impact"" and land destroyed by overgrazing and the country's ""damming craze"".""And since we discovered eight [butterfly] species new to science we realised that a number of species probably went extinct without ever being discovered, so that was really eye opening.""This inspired the creation of the KuzeyDoğa Society — a conservation group founded by Dr Şekercioğlu in 2008 to preserve the critical wildlife habits of the east. KuzeyDoğa Society has so far recorded 313 bird species in this ""globally critical"" region.(Supplied: Çağan H Şekercioğlu)After recording 313 bird species in this ""globally critical"" region, the team saw the levels of Lake Kuyucuk begin to drop due to ill-planned and illegal blocking of all five streams feeding the lake for agricultural use.Complaints to local government only led to attempts to stop the team's conservation work and ""silence them"".By 2018, this once 230-hectare lake was ""completely gone"".'It's not too late' Mr Şekercioğlu believes there is still time to save Kuyucuk and other disappearing lakes across the world.(Supplied: Çağan H Şekercioğlu)""To save the lake from disappearing permanently, we had to provide it with emergency water,"" Dr Şekercioğlu said.They began pumping underground water to replenish part of the lake, effectively putting the region's ecology on ""life support"". Dr Cagan says Lake Kuyucuk was previously home to hundreds of bird species.(Supplied: Çağan H Şekercioğlu)""As an ecologist, I know this is not a sustainable solution … but we just had to keep it going,"" he said.""Meanwhile, we worked with the government to convince local villagers to take down two of the smaller dams.""In December last year, they had a breakthrough, after the Kars provincial governor ordered the largest illegal dam to be taken down.""We were so excited,"" he recalled, but the local farmers who say they need the water for their livestock and crops, simply rented a bulldozer and rebuilt it within weeks.The fight continues as the team face threats for their conservation efforts.In the meantime, what remains of the lake is a wet marshland with some water in the centre.""It's no longer like the lake it used to be,"" he said, adding that the loss in bird numbers was staggering.""In the fall when it's like the most important time, it used to have 40,000 to 45,000 birds and now it's got a few thousand.""Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume.WatchDuration: 33 seconds33s0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemSeek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00  Drone footage shows thousands of dead flamingos at Türkiye's Lake Tuz.But he believes there is still time to save Kuyucuk and other disappearing lakes across the world.""It's not too late because most of it is due to human impact,"" Dr Şekercioğlu said.""People simply blame climate change instead of solving the human problem. They say, 'oh, it's because of climate change that the forests are burning. It's climate change that is drying the lakes. What can we do?'""But he says in reality, there's a lot that can be done through efficient water usage.""If the government enforces existing laws about water usage and damming it can be reversed,"" he said, adding that agriculture doesn't need to suffer. Changing to drip irrigation could significantly reduce agricultural water consumption in Türkiye.(Supplied: Bayram Çini)In recent years, The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has stated that models were being created to reduce water use and promote crops with low water consumption.Dr Şekercioğlu said by some estimates, a simple change to drip irrigation could reduce agricultural water consumption in Türkiye by up to 90 per cent.But currently, most of the country's irrigation is via open channels, resulting in huge evaporation loss, and if nothing changes, he said, in the coming years ""we will lose dozens more lakes and wetlands"".Türkiye's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change did not respond to requests for comment.Posted 27 May 202327 May 2023Sat 27 May 2023 at 8:56pm, updated 21h ago21 hours agoFri 2 Jun 2023 at 11:33pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesThousands of flamingos die at Turkish lake amid drought'The droughts are coming': This year El Niño is coming at a particularly dangerous time for the Pacific.

Matthew Torenius wants access to 'wood-bank' forests set aside by the state government.(ABC News: Jano Gibson)There are 16 people employed at his facility, where large logs sourced from native forests are cut into smaller sections for flooring, architraves, and joinery.But the future of Tasmania's native timber industry is once again in the spotlight following a major political decision across Bass Strait earlier this week.The Victorian government has announced the end of native timber logging, bringing forward the demise of a local industry that was previously set to be phased out by 2030.The decision, which included a $200 million transition package, caused shock and disappointment among the estimated 4,000 people who work in Victoria's native forest supply chain.Saving the FranklinDecades before any climate blockades, young people put their bodies on the line to save a wild river. Here's what we can learn from them today.Read moreBut for conservationists, it's seen as a pivotal moment in their campaign to end native forest logging across the country.""The dominoes are falling,"" the Bob Brown Foundation (BBF) declared in a press release.""First WA, and now Victoria — Tasmania, Queensland and NSW must be next.""The foundation, whose namesake made his mark protesting dams and logging in Tasmania, is focusing much of its attention on the island state.But far from accepting the push to end native forest logging, one sector of the local industry is calling for access to some areas previously set aside for conservation under a peace deal signed a decade ago.The tension between the two opposing sides has once again raised the spectre of a return to the so-called ""forest wars"", should the Tasmanian government agree to the industry's calls.""People will stand up to protect those forests,"" Bob Brown Foundation campaign manager Jenny Weber said. Jenny Weber's group is campaigning to end native forest logging.(ABC News: Jano Gibson)Sawmillers seek access to new coupesEnvironmental groups say native forest logging destroys the habitat of critically endangered species like the swift parrot, in addition to creating carbon emissions from burning off harvested areas for regeneration.While their direct actions have led to dozens of arrests in recent years, the scale of protests are significantly smaller than those seen prior to the signing of the Tasmanian Forest Agreement in 2012.That agreement, which was supported by the then Labor government, set aside half a million hectares of high conservation value forests, much of it as future reserves.In return, the industry was given annual rights to 137,000 cubic metres of high-quality sawlogs from areas where timber production is allowed on a permanent basis.The deal was repealed by the Liberal government in 2014, which designated about 400,000 hectares of the reserves as a ""wood bank"", known as Future Potential Production Forest (FPPF) land. Native timber logs at the Torenius sawmill in Hobart(ABC News: Jano Gibson)Almost a decade later, the Tasmanian Sawmillers Association wants the government to consider finally utilising those FPPF lands.""This land does really sit in bit of a no-man's land,"" Mr Torenius said.""Whilst it's touted as future production forests, it hasn't been touched.""Mr Torenius points to industry forecasts as motivation for his organisation's stance.The forecasts show that from 2027 onwards, the proportion of sawlogs sourced from native forests will drop to 58,000 cubic metres, with the remainder delivered through plantation supplies.""What you don't get in plantations as much is that high quality, slower-grown timber that is used for higher-end products, whether that be flooring, whether that be for furniture makers.""Green groups say industry push is a 'no-no' Logged Sustainable Timber Tasmania coupes seen from Maydena. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)Mr Torenius is urging the government to consider a direct swap of existing production areas with FPPF land because it wouldn't affect the overall amount of land where harvesting can occur.""I don't think anyone in the industry wants to have a war with the environmentalists,"" he said.""This is about having the discussions, even with the government, saying, 'Well, what do we do with this future area?' It can't essentially sit in a no-man's land forever."" Wilderness Society campaign manager Tom Allen says the industry is ""transitioning backwards"".(ABC News: Luke Bowden)But environmental groups like The Wilderness Society, which was involved in the original peace deal, say any moves to swap the land would be a backward step.""What better example of forestry in Tasmania being unsustainable, that it now seeks to log outside the production forests and to log high conservation value forests,"" its campaign manager Tom Allen said.""That's a no-no.'""Mr Allen is particularly incensed that after receiving a significant compensation package as part of the peace deal, the industry is pushing for access to new areas.""The rest of the country is transitioning forwards. The industry in Tasmania is basically asking the taxpayer to fund it transitioning backwards and we can't afford to go backwards.""Any move to allow harvesting in the native forests in question would require the approval of both houses of parliament.Minister open to changes The Tasmanian government says it'll consider backing the industry's push.(ABC News: Jano Gibson)Resources Minister Felix Ellis said he was open to backing such a push.""Where industry can demonstrate the need, then we'll be definitely considering that,"" he said.In the meantime, he said Victoria's decision had opened opportunities for the Tasmanian industry, including increased demand.Get Tas alerts on the ABC News appHere are the steps to get breaking news alerts on the latest Tasmanian stories directly to your phone. 📱Download the ABC News app — Apple App Store | Google Play""Our forestry sector wasn't set up for different states to make such terrible decisions as this,"" he said.""And we'll need to work through to make sure that we maximise local processing, local capability, and local jobs.""The Tasmanian Forest Products Association (TFPA) would not say whether it also wanted some of the FPPF land to be made available for harvest.""The TFPA has faith in the government to ensure that the estate, and our future resource security, will be correctly managed,"" chief executive Nick Steel said.Sustainable Timber Tasmania, the government business enterprise that manages the state's production forests, said it injected more than $100 million into the local economy in 2021-22.It also said if swift parrots are located near active forest operations, it manages the situation in accordance with recommendations from the Forest Practices Authority.[ Green groups have vowed to keep up protests against native logging but the industry says ""no one wants to have a war"".(Supplied)Want more Tasmanian news?Set the ABC News website or the app to ""Tasmania Top Stories"" from either the home page or the settings menu in the app to continue getting the same national news but with a sprinkle of more relevant state stories.Here's a taste of the latest stories from Tasmania 📰Tasmania's 2023/2024 state budget explainedHas there been any progress on a treaty in Tasmania?Shooting deer from helicopters reduces population by over 700Spectre of 'forest wars' returns to Tasmania after Victoria's decision to end native forest loggingStrength of ABC reporting on show at 2023 Tasmanian media awardsContact ABC NewsAll fields are required unless marked optional.EmailWhat are you contacting us about?Select an optionSelect an optionI have a tip I have feedbackOtherSubmitPosted 27 May 202327 May 2023Sat 27 May 2023 at 1:54am, updated 28 May 202328 May 2023Sun 28 May 2023 at 11:12pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated Stories Australia's best 'gravity' park is gearing up for a world series — right next to logging'Chainsaws already operating': Tasmanian farmer battles sudden logging of native forestWhat is the technical issue that has thrown decades of logging into doubt?This town has become an eco-tourism hub.

BOM has forecast overnight minimum temperatures to fall well below zero across large swathes of the country on Sunday.(Supplied: BOM)Among the worst hit areas are eastern New South Wales away from the coastal fringe, the ACT, southern Queensland, central Australia and inland south-west WA.Mr Hines said the chilly weather would last until mid-next week.""Unfortunately it's not like we're going to flip a switch on Monday, it's still going to be clear and cold on Monday into Tuesday,"" he said.""Large parts of the country will start to warm though, Tuesday and Wednesday, as we sort of get that next pulse of the warmer northerly wind setting up across parts of Australia.""Frost trends changingFrost is a common occurrence this time of year for southern and central Australia, generally setting in during late autumn and finishing in early spring.The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report projected, with high confidence, that frost events would decrease, in general, across southern Australia in the future with climate change.But other research has shown, at a more local scale, the downward trend of frost events hasn't been so clear. The frost season has been lengthening across southern Australia.(Supplied: Tiana Morriss - file photo)Some parts of the country have even seen an increase in the number of annual frost days, according to data from the Australian National University (ANU), while neighbouring regions have decreased.ANU climate applications scientist Steven Crimp said some parts of New South Wales were now experiencing five more frost events on average each year, compared to 1960.He said this was based on local weather station data between 1960 and 2018, but the trend was unlikely to have changed much in the past five years.""I think this is one of those climate surprises,"" he said.""Despite the sort of overall warming trend in our temperatures, the extremes of our temperatures, be they hot or cold, are acting in a slightly more nuanced and complex way, which can be quite surprising at times,"" he said. The icy crunch under foot is common in southern and central Australia from late autumn to early spring.(Supplied: Dianne Dray)Dr Crimp said they had also found the frost season was lengthening across southern Australia.""So if we think about the east coast first, we see an earlier start and a later finish to that frost window,"" he said.""In some cases, the extension of that frost window is greater than 40 days.""But in Western Australia in particular, we see that it's less to do with the later frost occurrence, but more earlier frost occurrence.""Why aren't frost days decreasing?Dr Crimp said, ironically, the observations could be explained by the types of weather system that brought warmer, drier weather.That was high pressure systems which often produced the clear, still nights needed for frost to settle.""As anyone knows who's outside at night in winter, you have to have those clear night skies and the atmosphere needs to be very dry,"" he said.""That way the surface of the Earth loses heat very rapidly and any moisture in the air then condenses as a frost.""So because we are getting those dry conditions that are starting to emerge, that is more conducive for frosts to occur.""Posted 26 May 202326 May 2023Fri 26 May 2023 at 10:52pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesWhere has snow historically fallen in Australia outside of the alpine regions?The BOM just updated its El Niño projections.

It's a great feeling,"" fourth-generation director Robert Mackenzie said.The project is part of the livestock sector's push to reduce emissions as Australia works to shrink its carbon footprint. Young cattle on Woko Station near Gloucester have gained, on average, 45kg more this year.(ABC Upper Hunter: Jennifer Ingall)Sheep and cattle are among the biggest contributors to Australian agriculture's emissions, but the livestock sector has not shied away from playing its part.In 2017, industry group Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) set a goal for the red meat sector to be carbon neutral by 2030.Since then, Australia has committed to net zero emissions by 2050.""The agriculture sector is doing the heavy lifting,"" MLA managing director Jason Strong said.""Since 2005, which is the baseline year, the livestock sector in Australia has reduced our emissions by 59 per cent; it's only about 10 per cent of the total emissions now."" Robert Mackenzie, pictured with sons Jack and James, wants the land in better condition for future generations.(ABC Upper Hunter: Jennifer Ingall)Uncertainty at first, results nowMr Mackenzie was intrigued by the carbon-neutral-by-2030 (CN30) goal set by MLA, but said like many producers at the time, he had plenty of questions.""Does this mean we're going to lock up land? Does this mean we're going to have to plant thousands of trees? How are we going to achieve this?""After gaining a baseline of his properties' soil and using innovative technology to map the land, Mr Mackenzie found that small tweaks could make a difference.""We're just focusing on what our forefathers did but just accelerating it a bit,"" he said.""Move our stock a bit more, mulch a bit more, aerate when the season is right and implement new pasture and seed."" Hayden Hollis has been conducting thousands of tests to confirm the carbon neutrality.(ABC Upper Hunter: Jennifer Ingall)Agronomist Hayden Hollis has been conducting thousands of tests across the Mackenzies' combined 6,500-hectare holdings and said it was an exciting journey to be part of.Initial soil tests helped rank the land into categories based on their silt, sand and clay composition, which then guided decisions on variables like pasture types and fertiliser and mulching rates.What does 'carbon neutral' really mean?Climate Active is a government-backed carbon-neutral certification scheme which claims to offer one of the world's ""most rigorous"" certification systems. But critics say it's engaging in ""greenwashing"".Read moreThe tests are conducted in line with the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) guidelines in which a minimum of 30 centimetres is tested.Mr Hollis said a ""substantial increase"" in sequestered carbon was made between 2022 and 2023.""We saw a 540-kilogram increase of sequestered carbon per hectare, which is a huge gain considering the infancy of the project.""In total, about 9,500 tonnes of carbon has been sequestered, weighing a bit more than a fully loaded coal train. A mix of rye-grasses, chicory, clover and kikuyu make up some of the pastures at one property near Gloucester.(ABC Upper Hunter: Amelia Bernasconi)Drought protectionThe amount of stored carbon can fluctuate depending on rainfall.In a high rainfall year, inputs increase in response to plant growth and in dry seasons carbon inputs drop.But Mr Mackenzie said they chose tap-rooted pasture species to ""lock the carbon deep in the soil"".He was confident it would help protect the farms during the next inevitable dry spell.Will regional chaos delay net zero goals?The roll-out of large scale renewable projects in the regions could be hampered if communities aren't meaningfully engaged.Read more""We found that for 1 per cent extra carbon gain in the soil, it's holding 160,000 litres more water in that particular hectare.""So when it comes to dry times, our grass is still growing; it doesn't drought-proof it, but it just helps us through those dry periods.""He is also producing more pasture than his cattle need.""In the last six months we've produced 2,100 tonnes extra silage and we've baled that and buried it strategically under the ground to future drought-proof us."" Macka's Pastoral supplies beef domestically and exports to Asia and the Middle East.(ABC Upper Hunter: Jennifer Ingall)Macka's Pastoral has invested heavily in the genetics of their Black Angus business, setting Australian records when buying a bull in 2021 and with a heifer last year.While there were some significant up-front costs, Mr Mackenzie said they were now seeing strong returns.""For example, we put the exact same bulls over the exact same group of cows last year as we did the year before, we rotated those cows through the exact same paddocks, and we've had a 45 kg weight gain average right across those 120 cows and calves.""Can the livestock industry reach CN2030?Mr Strong said MLA's 2030 goal for the red meat sector was achievable but they were still learning.""We are absolutely building the plane as we're flying it."" Jason Strong believes the industry can be part of the climate solution.(Supplied: Meat and Livestock Australia)But he said it was important the industry was in control.""Climate is the most important thing to consumers in the world, we see it driving elections, yet most consumers aren't changing their purchase behaviour as a result of that, they see the responsibility sitting with somebody else.""There are no consumers picketing meat cases saying, 'Give me carbon-neutral beef', but we know at some point that's going to change.""The best thing we can be doing is being in front of that, and when somebody does ask us that question, we can say, 'It's OK, we already have it'.""

Gavin Dufty from St Vincent de Paul says headline price rises are likely to be worse for battlers.(ABC News: Amy Bainbridge)Gavin Dufty, the policy and research manager at St Vincent de Paul, says regulators face a tough task in calibrating the offers every year.Set them too small, Mr Dufty says, and those customers directly affected might take less of a hit but retailers will also be less inclined to offer discounts to other consumers.Set them too high, Mr Dufty says, and those same retailers might have an incentive to offer bigger discounts in the broader market but households directly on the hook for the default offer will cop it in the neck.In the case of these latest price hikes, he says the regulators undoubtedly had to take into account the unprecedented wholesale market turmoil and high prices of the past 12 months.And to that extent, he says the hikes are not unreasonable.But the veteran energy researcher is worried the headline numbers mask a much bigger, structural problem.""The averages tell a little bit of a lie about how this will wash through the community,"" Mr Dufty said.At the heart of those concerns is the divide between households with the money and the wherewithal to shield themselves from rising electricity prices and those who might lack them.The most obvious example of this gulf is the rise of the solar household. Ever more Australians are installing solar panels to avoid rising power costs.(ABC News: Christopher Gillette)Solar panels have an upfront cost of several thousand dollars, but that investment is recouped and typically repaid handsomely as customers generate big chunks of their own electricity.Add in a home battery, which usually costs several thousand dollars more, and electricity bills can be completely eradicated.Energy divide grows widerMr Dufty, himself a solar householder, says the benefits of such technologies are huge.But he notes that many people don't yet have a system, while many more such as renters and poor households may never be able to get one.As such, he said the weight of electricity price rises like those announced by the AER and the ESC are likely to fall disproportionately on disadvantaged consumers.What's more, he says it's a problem that looks set to get worse as more and more households migrate towards solar panels and batteries and those unable to follow suit have to pick up an ever greater share of the tab.""One of the things we do worry about at Vinnies is the price increase – whatever the number – is for an average,"" Mr Dufty said.""And what we do know is there's a lot more diversity in households now.""Those with solar, for example, will have much lower price increases. The energy efficiency of appliances has a major bearing on a householder's power bills.(ABC News: Natasha Johnson)""But those large families, all-electric, living in colder areas, are going to have significantly higher price increases.""Governments and industry are aware of the equity risks in the transition.A package of relief measures drawn up by the Commonwealth and states to cushion the effects of the energy crisis has been skewed in favour of those less well off.Can't leave half behind: GriffithEarlier this month, the Federal Government used its second Budget to set aside money to help ""low-income Australians"" get rid of their gas appliances and improve their energy efficiency.But those efforts on their own will do little.Saul Griffith, the Australian inventor and flag-bearer for the electrification push, has argued fixing inequalities must go hand-in-hand with the shift.In his 2021 book, The Big Switch, Griffith spelt out the opportunities, but also the challenges, that lay ahead. Saul Griffith says the energy transition must not leave the disadvantaged behind.(Australian Story: Jack Fisher)""It should be simple enough to understand the statement that you cannot half-solve climate change,"" Dr Griffith wrote.""You can't have half the people subscribing to, and affording, the solutions, while leaving the less wealthy half behind.""[M]any people likely feel that they can't afford the technological wonders that are at least a good part of the answer to climate change: electric cars, rooftop solar systems, a household battery, heat pumps.""If we choose to actually address climate change we are de facto choosing to help everyone afford those solutions.""Posted 25 May 202325 May 2023Thu 25 May 2023 at 8:47pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated Stories'Obscenely high prices': Customers and businesses brace for surge in power bills from July 1Millions to receive up to $500 in energy bill relief as Treasurer flags broader cost of living supportBillion-dollar plan to electrify Australia's homes would 'slay inflation and slash bills', group says'Quite stark': Report says gulf between rich and poor households expands as costs accelerateMore on:ACTAdelaideAustraliaClimate ChangeElectricity Production and DistributionEnergy IndustryGovernment and PoliticsMelbourneNSWPovertyQLDSASocial PolicyTASVICWATop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Three Israeli soldiers, Egyptian officer killed in rare gun battle along Israel-Egypt borderHawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

India experienced a heatwave of similar magnitude last year.(Supplied: Manish Swarup)It is the second year in a row heat extremes have been recorded over the region.Extreme heat that set in across India and Pakistan last year resulting in the hottest March in the subcontinent in more a century, extending into April.It killed 90 people.Dr Ramesh said the frequency of such extremes was ""sounding alarm bells"".""I think people are aware that this is really not good,"" she said.It comes as a World Meteorological Organisation report found there was a 98 per cent chance one of the next five years would be the warmest recorded. A rickshaw puller splashes water on his face to get relief last month in Dhaka, Bangladesh.(AFP:Rehman Asad/NurPhoto)El Niño likely to exacerbate heatWhile cooling rains are now prevailing across the continent, climatologists say the likely development of El Niño could exacerbate the heat further.India Institute of Tropical Meteorology climatologist Jasti Chowdary said El Niño was typically associated with a delay in the onset of the monsoon, which arrived in June.The Indian Meteorological Department has issued a statement predicting the onset of the monsoon would start four days late. Motorbike riders are seen through heat haze in Bangkok last month.(Reuters: Chalinee Thirasupa)Dr Chowdary said a delay could have significant consequences.""If the progress of the monsoon is slow, the heat might prevail over north-west parts of India and it may have noteworthy consequences,"" he said.But Dr Chowdary and Dr Ramesh said El Niño was unlikely to have played a role in the heat to-date.Dr Chowdary said the fingerprint of climate change and lingering warm waters in surrounding oceans were likely to have helped drive the unusual heat.YouTube A UN report says the world is likely to pass 1.5C threshold over next few years.""Southeast Asia is so closely related to temperatures for the Western Pacific as well,"" he said.""This year, because there was a prolonged La Nina, it has caused the Indian Ocean as well as the Western Pacific to become warmer and that warming is persisting.""When you have this strong warming [plus] a high pressure system, it is probably going to influence the heatwave conditions over that region.""Dr Chowdary said Cyclone Mocha also played a role in the prolonged dry conditions across parts of India in May.Could Australia face similar impacts?Dr Ramesh said the humidity associated with Asia's heatwave made conditions there particularly dangerous.""It makes it much harder for the human body to tolerate,"" she said. While Asia's heatwave has been developing in a tropical climate, different to southern Australia, the general forces at play could hint at what is to come.El Niño is known to bring drier, warmer conditions to eastern Australia.The Bureau of Meteorology is projecting a 50 per cent chance it will form this winter or spring, while the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has put the odds at a much higher 90 per cent.Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted 25 May 202325 May 2023Thu 25 May 2023 at 3:26amShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesAsia swelters in record-breaking heatwaveThere's a 98 per cent chance one of the next five years will be the hottest ever, new UN report saysMore on:ChinaClimate ChangeEnvironmentIndiaMelbourneMyanmarPakistanThailandWeatherWeather PhenomenaTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Three Israeli soldiers, Egyptian officer killed in rare gun battle along Israel-Egypt borderHawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

There's no electricity unless you have a generator [or] partial generator. Reassure your children,"" Brandon Aydlett, a National Weather Service operations officer, told a briefing, according to The Guam Daily Post. Authorities ordered people in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.(Reuters: Romeo Ranoco)Want to stay up to date with what's happening in the Pacific? Sign up for the ABC Pacific newsletterAt one of the island's many hotels, the 30-floor Dusit Thani Guam Resort which houses around 300 guests, desk clerk Casey Hattori said the lobby was flooded with a foot of water.Outside, trees snapped in howling wind.""I can hear the walls shaking. The wind is super strong. I can hear it whistling as it comes through the cracks of the doors,"" Ms Hattori told AFP.Fearful tourists were evacuated from flooded rooms to a sixth-floor ballroom, she said.YouTube Guam governor Lou Leon Guerrero has called on residents to keep off the streets despite the easing of Typhoon Mawar.Authorities were preparing to assess the damage, Mr Aydlett said. ""It looks like a scene from the movie Twister, with things just thrashed apart,"" he said. ""Lots of Guam is dealing with a major mess that's going to take weeks to clean up,"" he added.J Asprer, a police officer in the Dededo precinct in northern Guam, said before dawn that he had not received any reports of injuries but several police cars and personal vehicles had been damaged by debris, and uprooted trees made some roads impassible.Most of the calls overnight came from worried people off-island who were unable to reach family members, Mr Asprer said.""We told them we'll have to wait until the storm clears up a bit,"" he said. Strong winds and heavy rain knocked down trees, walls and power lines in Guam.(AP: US Coast Guard)US navy deployed to help recovery effortThe US navy has ordered the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group to head to the island to assist in the recovery effort.The Nimitz, along with the USS Bunker Hill, a cruiser, and the USS Wayne E Meyer, a destroyer, were south of Japan and expected to arrive in Guam in three or four days, said a US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ship movements not yet made public.The weather service said the storm made landfall at around 9pm on Wednesday in Guam, which is about 6,115 kilometres west of Hawaii and 1,575 kilometres east of the Manila, the capital of the Philippines.""It was on land for about 30 to 35 minutes before it moved back off shore,"" Mr Doll said.By early Thursday, Mawar was centred 121 kilometres north-west of the island and 137 kilometres west of Rota, Guam's neighbour to the north, moving west-north-west at 13 kilometres per hour.Mawar, a Malaysian word that means ""rose"", could threaten Taiwan next week.Ahead of the storm, Guam governor Lou Leon Guerrero ordered those living in coastal, low-lying and flood-prone areas to evacuate to higher ground.The highest point on the island is Mount Lamlam in the south-west at 406 metres.But much of the beachfront tourist district of Tamuning, where many resorts are located, is close to sea level.

Over the past year, they have also targeted various artworks and exhibits.Prosecutors are investigating seven suspects aged between 22 and 38 on suspicion of forming or backing a criminal organisation, police said. No arrests have been made.""At the current stage of the proceedings, we have affirmed the facts of criminal association,"" said Klaus Ruhland, Munich public prosecutor's office spokesperson, and evidence seized in searches would be evaluated in the coming weeks.Last Generation said all of its activities were transparent and not criminal, and that activists show their faces and names during protests and announce their events in advance.""Do we have to experience a drought in Germany first, suffer from food shortages … before we understand that Last Generation is … not criminal?"" spokesperson Aimee Van Baalen told journalists in Berlin on Wednesday.""They make us afraid, but we must not be frozen by fear."" Police removed a climate activist's hand from a Berlin road with hammer and chisel.(AP: Markus Schreiber)Police said the seven suspects are believed to have been raising funds to finance further crimes on behalf of Last Generation, collecting at least 1.4 million euros ($2.3 million) in donations.Bavarian state police said they had shut down the homepage of the group's website, as donating to the group was considered illegal.Two of the defendants are suspected of sabotaging the Trieste-Ingolstadt oil pipeline — deemed critical infrastructure and so subject to special protection — in April last year.The raids come days after Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that he thought it was ""completely nutty to somehow stick yourself to a painting or on the street"".Leading figures with the environmentalist Green party, part of his governing coalition, have also said the group's actions are counterproductive.Last Generation has acknowledged in the past that its protests are provocative, but argues that by stirring friction it can encourage debate within society about climate change and the policies necessary to stop it. Last Generation spokesperson Aimee Van Baalen says the climate activist group is not criminal.(Reuters: Annegret Hilse)Ms Van Baalen urged all Germans to join the next protest marches by the group set for May 31 to demand quicker and tougher action against climate change, including a ban on the use of fossil fuels by 2030.""The German government is right now driving us toward climate hell with its eyes wide open. It is even stepping on the gas pedal,"" she said.""We must now continue to resist.""Other German environmental groups criticised the searches, saying they undermined the constitutional right to peaceful protest.In remarks quoted by Funke Media Group, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the rule of law in Germany was clear — ""legitimate protest always ends where criminal offences are committed and the rights of others are violated"".Reuters/APPosted 24 May 202324 May 2023Wed 24 May 2023 at 9:02pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesPolice wade through Trevi fountain as climate protesters turn water blackMore climate change protesters arrested, as SA government plans severe crackdownJail sentence overturned for climate change activist who blocked Sydney Harbour BridgeMore on:Activism and LobbyingClimate ChangeCommunity and SocietyDisasters and AccidentsEnvironmentEnvironmental ImpactEnvironmental PolicyEuropean UnionGermanyGovernment and PoliticsLaw, Crime and JusticeWorld PoliticsTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Three Israeli soldiers, Egyptian officer killed in rare gun battle along Israel-Egypt borderHawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

Sign up to ABC North Coast's weekly email newsletter.Bigger floods will happenRecent years have been catastrophic for flooding in Australia and around the world.One thousand people died from flooding in Pakistan, the damage bill from Hurricane Ian in the United States was more than US$100 billion.In Australia, 38 have people died in recent floods, and the damage bill for the floods in Northern NSW and south-east Queensland is more than $5 billion, making it the most expensive disaster in Australian history. Extreme flooding throughout NSW means residents can never say never when considering future flood threat.(Supplied)Mr Dinham warned Australians to expect more of the same.""Unprecedented floods can and will happen in the future,"" he said.""We need to come together, pool our thoughts and deal with what we know is coming down the road.""Outdated planning guidelinesTom Remenyi is a climate researcher and director of the climate education agency Acclimatised.He has studied climate in relation to agriculture and the environment.

These two things are certainties.""Dangerous places to farmThe conference also heard about the dangers of farming in the future. Farming is a dangerous occupation and Dr Remenyi wants farmers to be considered in government policy.(Supplied: Camille Camp)""It needs to be done in the best place for that task and sometimes the best place is a dangerous place; a floodplain,"" Dr Remenyi said.""We have destroyed riparian zones across Australia, which hold our river systems in place.""We need to re-build these zones so the water gets filtered by the natural system and gets slowed down and pushed out into the sub-soils.""That could mean giving up some prime farming land, which Dr Remenyi says must be done in fair ways to farmers and without hindering the nation's food supply.The ABC approached the NSW Department of Planning and Environment, which had presenters at the conference, but they were not available for interview.Local news direct to your inboxABC North Coast will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

Taking a flight would take approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes, with a high-speed train it would take about 1 hour and 57 minutes.In an effort to reduce France's emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, short-haul flights will no longer be available. Although the measure was included in a 2021 climate law and already applied in practice, some airlines had asked the European Commission to investigate whether it was legal.The change will mostly rule out air trips between Paris and regional hubs such as Nantes, Lyon (both about a five-hour drive) and Bordeaux (almost a six-and-a-half hour drive), with connecting flights unaffected.Critics have noted that the cut-off point for comparable train journeys is shy of the roughly three hours it takes to travel from Paris to the Mediterranean port city Marseille by high-speed rail. The ban is intended to encourage travellers to take high-speed trains.(Reuters: Gonzalo Fuentes)The law states that train services on the same route must be able to absorb the increase in passenger numbers and that they must be frequent, timely and well connected to meet needs of the passengers who would otherwise take a short-haul flight. People making such trips should be able to make outbound and return train journeys on the same day, having spent eight hours at their destination.The government had already secured Air France's compliance with the plan in exchange for a 2020 coronavirus financial support package.Competitors were banned from simply filling the gap.'Symbolic bans' Laurent Donceel, who is the interim head of industry group Airlines for Europe (A4E) said governments should support ""real and significant solutions"" to airline emissions, rather than ""symbolic bans"".Brussels had found that ""banning these trips will only have minimal effects"" on CO2 output, he added.A4E highlighted its own net zero by 2050 strategy, which includes switching to jet fuel from non-fossil sources and deploying battery- or hydrogen-powered aircraft.The step comes as French politicians have also been debating how to reduce emissions from private jets.While Green MPs have called for banning small private flights altogether, Transport Minister Clement Beaune last month trailed a higher climate charge for users from next year.ABC/wiresPosted 24 May 202324 May 2023Wed 24 May 2023 at 12:54amShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterMore on:Air PollutionAir Transport IndustryClimate ChangeForeign AffairsFranceTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Three Israeli soldiers, Egyptian officer killed in rare gun battle along Israel-Egypt borderHawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

Who is right?ShareEl Niño predictions differ between US and Australian forecast agencies. Who is right?By weather reporter Tyne LoganPosted Tue 23 May 2023 at 6:12amTuesday 23 May 2023 at 6:12amTue 23 May 2023 at 6:12am BOM is predicting a 50 per cent chance of El Niño developing this winter or spring, while NOAA says it's 90.(ABC News: Sharon Gordon)Help keep family & friends informed by sharing this articleabc.net.au/news/noaa-bom-el-nino-chances-explored/102341466Link copiedCopy linkShareThe US and Australia's chief forecasting agencies are projecting vastly different odds on the development of an El Niño climate pattern this year.In their latest climate update, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has remained firm on their projection that there is a 50 per cent chance of the major climate driver, linked to warmer, drier weather, developing this winter or spring.Meanwhile, US forecast agency National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has tipped El Niño an almost foregone conclusion now at a 90 per cent chance of developing this year.The significantly different figures can seem perplexing. After all, all agencies are looking at the same part of the Pacific Ocean.So why is there a difference, and who is right?Australia monitors atmospheric changesAt its core, the reason for the differing odds is fairly simple – the US and Australia base their probability on different criteria, and the BOM's is stricter.To understand the difference, you must first understand how El Niño works.El Niño is known as a ""coupled"" phenomenon, where conditions in the ocean interact with the atmosphere and become self re-enforcing. El Niño describes a shift in ocean and weather patterns across the Pacific which carries rain away from Australia.(Supplied: BOM)During the event, waters in the central and eastern part of the tropical Pacific become unusually warm, weakening the trade winds that blow from east to west around the globe.The weaker trade winds keep the pool of warm water confined to the eastern Pacific, and the stronger pool of warm water in the eastern Pacific weakens the trade winds.As a result, the warm water encourages the development of cloud and tropical rainfall closer to South America, while Australia misses out. El Niño is linked to warmer, drier weather in Australia's east and has a reputation for bringing drought.(ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Andrew Chounding)Atmospheric scientist Kimberley Reid, from Monash University, said this interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere was an important distinction between the NOAA and BOM's criteria.Dr Reid said when determining the probability of an El Niño, NOAA was placing emphasis primarily on sea surface temperatures.Whereas the BOM requires both the ocean and the atmosphere to be showing signs of change before they upgrade the likelihood to an El Niño ""alert"", which means a 70 per cent chance.The BOM also requires sea surface temperatures to be warmer than NOAA does. NOAA and the BOM both take sea surface temperature observations at a point of the Pacific known as NINO3.4.(Supplied: NOAA)More specifically, NOAA's outlook is based on the probability that sea surface temperatures at NINO3.4 are more that 0.5 degrees Celsius warmer than normal for five consecutive, overlapping three-month periods. For example, May-June, June-August and July-September.But, for the BOM to move from El Niño ""watch"" to El Niño ""alert"", three of the following four criteria must be met:Sea surface temperature: A clear warming trend has been observed in the NINO3 or NINO3.4 regions of the Pacific Ocean during the past three to six months.Winds: Trade winds have been weaker than average in the western or central equatorial Pacific Ocean during any two of the past three months.Models: A majority of surveyed climate models show sustained warming to at least 0.8C above average in the NINO3 or NINO3.4 regions of the Pacific Ocean by the late winter or spring.Air pressure: A measure of air pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin has a two-month average value -7 or lower, based on the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).When it comes to actually declaring an El Niño underway, the criteria from both agencies become much closer, with both requiring observed changes in the atmosphere, although BOM still requires ocean temperatures to be warmer than NOAA.In a statement, the BOM said the current conditions plus forecasts were ""close"" to those required for shifting from a ""watch"" to ""alert"".But it said atmospheric conditions were keeping the odds at 50 per cent.Careful balance between raising false alarm, and early warningDr Reid said the BOM's stricter criteria were about being confident there were going to be the impacts from El Niño before the alarm was sounded.""People kind of know that El Niño equals hot and dry in Australia, farmers know that and they're constantly watching,"" she said.""But if the atmospheric conditions aren't pointing to El Niño or, as is the case right now, we've got warmer ocean temperatures [on both sides] of the Pacific, then we're not necessarily going to get that hot and dry outcome.""So the Bureau of Meteorology sort of has this stricter criteria because they don't want to be calling it an El Niño if we're not going to be getting these hot and dry conditions."" Average rain during winter and spring through previous El Niño episodes.(Supplied: BOM)She said, in contrast, the US and South America were not as influenced by conditions on the western side of the Pacific, near Australia, so this was less of a consideration.In a statement, the BOM said the different metrics between US, Australia and also Japan were tailored to their services around the impact of El Niño and La Niña.""The bureau considers its service best suited for Australia,"" it said.Dr Reid said there were benefits to the US criteria, too – namely early warning. Kimberley Reid says there are pros and cons to both methods.(Supplied: Kimberley Reid)""I think there's lots of benefits for people being told that a potential El Niño is coming, especially, in Australia for example, when it's been so wet the last few years,"" she said.""Vegetation has blossomed, and so if it becomes really hot and dry that means the next big fire season will be potentially bad.""So early warning means we can prepare for that.""Dr Reid said the flip to that was losing trust should an event not eventuate.""You don't want to tell everyone it's going to be hot and dry and then it doesn't happen, because you lose the public's confidence,"" she said.""I don't really have an opinion on which is better, necessarily, because I can see the benefits of both.""There have been instances where the models were suggesting prolonged warming in the ocean, but an El Niño or La Niña event didn't eventuate.This happened in 2014, when a strong El Niño was projected but did not occur that year, instead kicking in the following year.Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted 23 May 202323 May 2023Tue 23 May 2023 at 6:12amShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterRelated StoriesGreenhouse gases have changed El Niño and La Niña, significant new study findsAn El Niño looks likely to start before the end of the year.

We have certainly consulted with the department in the form of seeking probity advice for how we manage conflicts of interest,"" he said. ""Where there is the possibility that there's a conflict of interest on a matter before the authority, members will determine whether they consider that to be the case and determine how that is to be managed.""Overlapping interestsThe Australia Institute letter also raised concerns about other CCA board members it said had close links to the carbon offset, fossil fuel industries or climate change investment. Grant King is the former long-serving chief of Origin Energy.(ABC TV: Inside Business)It made no allegations of impropriety by any individual but said the recent scandal involving consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) highlighted concerns with potential conflicts of interest.""Australia would benefit from an inquiry that goes beyond consultancies to the management and assurance of integrity in public governance,"" Polly Hemming, Director of the Climate & Energy Program at the Australia Institute said.""It’s quite extraordinary that the CCA doesn’t appear to have sought formal advice that appointments to the board comply with legislation at any time over the past two years.""It’s even more extraordinary when you consider that the board appears to be largely in control of setting the research agenda of the CCA.""Ms Hemming said she believed there were serious integrity questions that needed to be answered. ""In one instance Grant King appears to have recused himself from duties as the CCA Chair due to potential conflicts. However, again, it’s not clear whether this was done in accordance with the legislation,"" she said. ""The CCA has a critical role in shaping Australia’s climate policy, yet there is no indication that its advice is robust and independent or that its governance is fit for purpose.""Mr Archer told estimates the authority will be publishing its charter in the coming weeks. What we found in this rainforest has been hidden from the worldAustralian businesses are trying to offset their emissions through carbon credit projects that promise to save rainforests.

Most of the world's new EVs contain lithium sourced from Australia.(Getty: Picture Alliance)A technology developed to power mobile phones has become critical for everything from clean transport to renewable grids.Global demand for batteries is forecast to increase tenfold over the next decade, and fortyfold by 2050.Now, one question is being asked, and its answer could shape Australia's prosperity for generations.Who makes the batteries?'Selling wool and buying back jumpers'Batteries are made in lots of places, from lots of materials.""A modern rechargeable battery is a highly advanced piece of technology,"" says Shannon O'Rourke, CEO of the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre (FBI CRC), based at Curtin University in Western Australia.""Though it looks simple from the outside, on the inside it contains precisely engineered materials made from the purest refined products.""The chart below shows the sequence of processes that turn raw minerals into a lithium-ion battery, and the share of total revenue each step of this value chain is estimated to represent by 2030.The step of cell manufacturing captures almost half the total revenue, but Australia currently doesn't manufacture lithium-ion cells at scale.Instead, its contribution is almost entirely through mining, which accounts for three cents in every dollar of total value.This financial year, Australia will export about $18.5 billion worth of lithium, or around half the global supply.Most of that lithium will be shipped to China, which is home to six of the world's 10 biggest battery manufacturers and dominates the global battery value chain.It's a similar story with other battery minerals, such as graphite, nickel, manganese, cobalt, vanadium, copper and aluminium. Australia is the only country with access to all battery minerals.(Supplied: Tawana Resources)Australia is essentially ""selling the wool and buying back jumpers"", says Brian Craighead, CEO of Renaissance Energy, an Australian battery maker.""That's basically what we do, we dig it up and send it out.""""We get 5 cents in the dollar and we live with that … but we can get 95 cents.""Chinese manufacturer claims new battery will power 1,000km EV rangeThe world's largest battery maker says its new battery could power electric aircraft or propel electric vehicles beyond 1,000km on a single charge.Read moreFor Australia to win a greater share of revenue, it will have to take on its trade partners at their own game of large-scale minerals processing and advanced manufacturing.The federal government is preparing a national strategy to do just that, and has promised concessional loans for the sector.Last week, it announced a ""growth centre"" to help businesses seeking to locally manufacture clean energy technologies.But within this emerging industry, there's concern that Australia is moving too slowly.""Everyone in this process including us is saying we need to make this go faster,"" says Steve McCartney, WA state secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU WA).Adam Best, a principal research scientist at the CSIRO, says the rest of the world is moving faster than Australia.""The opportunity is a short window, in my view.""Once these [battery-making] facilities are established [overseas], you won't move them.""Despite its natural advantages of resources and cheap energy, Australia could get stuck selling the wool and buying back jumpers.""Everyone wants to be a clean energy superpower,"" Mr O'Rourke says.""It's a competition, not a tagline.""Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume.WatchDuration: 4 minutes 23 seconds4m 23s Nicolette Boele of the Smart Energy Council says the US Inflation Reduction Act could lead to investment in Australia's critical minerals sector.(Kathryn Robinson)How to make a batteryThink of a lithium-ion battery as a tall, column-shaped wedding cake, the kind with layers of sponge and cream, except it's been laid flat on its side.""There are a lot of similarities to food manufacturing,"" says Rob Fitzpatrick, CEO of Recharge Industries, which is building what will be Australia's first large-scale factory to make lithium-ion cells.""You need to pump out tens of thousands of battery cells a day.""A typical battery has four main components: An anode that holds the lithium ions when charged, a cathode that holds them when discharged, a separator that is placed in the middle, and an electrolyte medium that enables movement of lithium ions between the cathode and anode. The basic components of a lithium-ion battery.(Getty Images: ser_igor)Like with making a cake, you start with the raw ingredients.For the purpose of this example, let's go with the type of battery found in most electric vehicles, e-bikes and power tools today.Known as an NMC, it has a cathode primarily made of nickel, manganese and cobalt.And just like with baking, making this cathode begins with a slurry.The component minerals are mined, crushed, separated and concentrated to create battery-grade, 99.99 per cent pure, nickel sulphate, manganese sulphate and cobalt sulphate.Lithium ore is converted to lithium hydroxide and mixed with each of these precursor materials. The FBI CRC's cathode precursor plant at Curtin University demonstrates the technology used to make the chemicals required for cell manufacturing.(Supplied: FBI CRC)These are then blended into a uniform mixture, along with a solvent, and coated on a current collector of aluminium foil thinner than a human hair.These coated foils are pressed and baked. The separator is layered between the anode (usually graphite) and the cathode, and then these are wound into a spiral before being pushed into a cylindrical cell casing.The electrolyte is injected into the cell, which is then charged and discharged, in a process of testing and grading cell capacity.Finally, these cells are combined into stacks, which in turn are assembled into racks, and connected to the electronic system that monitors their charge and health and controls the power output. Crystalline cathode precursor products are made by precisely controlling temperature, fluid circulation, acidity, and feedstock flow rates.(Supplied: FBI CRC)Sounds simple, right?Now consider that completing just one part of one of these steps requires its own multi-million-dollar facility.At Kwinana, crushed lithium ore is converted to lithium hydroxide by being dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid at high temperature.Powerful magnets are used to extract iron, to ensure the final product is free of iron to parts-per-billion levels.This Kwinana plant, which refines a small fraction of all the lithium mined in WA, cost $1 billion to build. The Tianqi Kwinana lithium hydroxide processing plant is the first in the world outside of China.(Supplied: Tianqi Lithium Kwinana)Recharge Industries' proposed Geelong ""gigafactory"", which will make lithium-ion cells and assemble them into batteries, requires a $4.8 billion investment over seven years, CEO Rob Fitzpatrick says.""The scale and size of it is breathtaking,"" Mr Fitzpatrick says.""For 6GWh of annual production, it's eight jumbo jets end-to-end long, and two jumbo jets wide.""This annual production figure is a fraction of Australia's projected storage requirements by 2030.""Global demand at that time is projected to be anywhere from 3,500 gigawatt-hours to 8,800 gigawatt-hours.""A commercial problem, not a technical oneManufacturing batteries is technically challenging, but this isn't what's slowing the industry's growth, experts say.The main hurdle is access to capital. Manufacturers have a chicken-and-egg type problem, where to make battery cells, they need access to battery minerals. Energy Renaissance recently began production at its battery ""gigafactory"" in Tomago, NSW.(Supplied: Energy Renaissance)But the battery minerals Australia makes have already been bought by battery manufacturers overseas, in multi-year offtake agreements.To get capital to expand battery minerals production, a producer needs to show the bank there will be demand for this product. It does this by selling what it says it will produce in the future.Start-up Australian battery manufacturers can't secure these offtake agreements, as they haven't made any batteries.""You need between three and five years of your [battery minerals products] offtake to be sold … for an Australian banking facility to back [this expansion],"" says Brian Craighead from Renaissance Energy.""They all largely have the same problem, which isn't a technical problem. It is a commercial problem.""Renaissance had planned to make lithium-ion cells in Australia, but couldn't secure a source of battery materials. Instead, it assembles batteries from imported lithium-ion cells, with plans to one day make its own.Recharge, meanwhile, plans to buy most of its battery minerals from overseas, until it can source them locally.CEO Rob Fitzpatrick says the industry is stuck in a loop of chasing capital, but not being able to prove its product or show it has customers. ""It's an absolutely eye-watering set of numbers to be able to create this [manufacturing] capability,"" he says.""[And the bank] is going to ask, 'Who are your customers?' Customers are going to go, 'Show me a product'. But you can't make products until you've got capital."" A rendering of Recharge Industries' planned Geelong gigafactory.(Supplied: Recharge Industries)He says one solution to this would be for the government to step in and provide start-up funding ahead of private investors.This may be a focus of the federal government's national battery strategy, expected later this year.The AMWU WA, meanwhile, backs the idea of the government building the infrastructure needed to, for instance, make battery chemicals, or manufacture cells, and then leasing this to companies.These government-owned ""common-use facilities"" would encourage small-to-medium enterprises to test ideas and develop their products, without having to raise lots of capital first, says the AMWU WA's Steve McCartney.""With this leased infrastructure, [they] will go in there and show what they can do.""This is how we minimise risk.""Competing with ChinaTwo weeks ago, the WA government announced plans to fund what will be Australia's biggest battery (2,000 megawatt-hours), in the coal centre of Collie.Along with a second, smaller battery in Kwinana, it will cost the state $2.8 billion.Neither will be substantially built in Australia.""I'm disappointed the two biggest batteries in WA will not be made in WA,"" Mr McCartney says.""We need to make sure we have a thriving industry by the time all these batteries need to be replaced.""In 10 years' time, Australia could have a full end-to-end value chain for lithium-ion batteries, operating at scale, says the FBI CRC. In a report published in March, the CRC forecast two scenarios for 2030. In one, Australia is mostly digging up and exporting unprocessed battery minerals, as it currently does. In the other, it's diversified into refining, cell manufacturing and battery assembly, while continuing to do mining.The industry in this second scenario would be worth $16.9 billion, or about a third more than the first, the CRC predicts.It would also generate about twice as much GDP and twice as many jobs, it says.Because materials and energy account for most of the cost of a battery, rather than labour, Australia could make some of the cheapest batteries in the world, says Shannon O'Rourke from the FBI CRC.""Australia is the only nation in the world with large resources of all the required critical minerals,"" he says. ""We are the only location with the minerals, cheap energy and industrial infrastructure to vertically integrate our domestic production and compete with China.""Recharge's Rob Fitzpatrick also says Australia can make cheaper batteries than other countries.""We believe that based on the bill of materials, going back to the chemistry and components, that we have a cost advantage,"" he says.What are vanadium redox flow batteries?A type of battery invented by an Australian professor in the 1980s is being touted as the next big technology for grid energy storage.Read moreMost of the batteries Australia could make would provide storage for energy grids, rather than electric vehicles, says Adam Best from the CSIRO.Australia doesn't make cars on a big scale and car-makers like to locate their car-making plants next to the battery-making ones.""There's a big export market for stationary storage for south-east Asia and the Pacific,"" he says.And like the CRC, he sees most of the revenue coming from a ""sweet spot"" in the value chain, around mining, refining and battery chemical manufacturing. But apart from money, having some sovereign battery manufacturing would be a good thing, he adds.Soon, most of Australia's two main power grids will be powered by renewables, meaning they'll be reliant on batteries and other storage.""If things go pear-shaped, we'll have to know how to make batteries,"" Mr Best says.For the first time in decades, state and federal governments are talking about manufacturing being a solution to growth, jobs and energy security, rather than a dying industry that has to be saved.""Considering the way we got cleaned out in the 1990s, and everything went offshore, it's music to my ears,"" Mr McCartney says.""I think everyone is excited about the opportunities.""Science in your inboxGet all the latest science stories from across the ABC.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted 22 May 202322 May 2023Mon 22 May 2023 at 8:00pm, updated 23 May 202323 May 2023Tue 23 May 2023 at 4:17amShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterMore on:Alternative EnergyAustraliaClimate ChangeCollieEnergyGeelongKwinana Town CentreMining and Metals IndustryScience and TechnologyTomagoTop StoriesHow spies used a shard of an exploded Nokia phone to expose the Bali bombers'We're building our own history': The fight for new ChinatownDavid Warner announces retirement plansRecord-breaking numbers are searching for flatmates with older generations increasing the mostOfficials announce end to rescue efforts at India's deadly rail accident Three Israeli soldiers, Egyptian officer killed in rare gun battle along Israel-Egypt borderHawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says he 'feels for everyone' linked to racism sagaUS teens are grappling with 'persistent sadness'.

The number of electric buses in public transport fleets is growing slowly.(Supplied: Translink)Dr Rayner said if that goal were to be achieved commuters would need to use a range of different transport modes, with a greater reliance on public and active transport.That would mean 49 per cent of trips would have to occur on public transport and 15 per cent through active transit.Private vehicles would account for the remaining 36 per cent.""That means about halving the amount of trips that are made by car every day, and seeing a three-and-a-half-fold increase in trips by public transport and a threefold increase of active transport, like walking cycling or skating,"" Dr Rayner said.""At the moment the average Australian household has two petrol cars in the garage.""Our vision in the future is that one of those be replaced by an EV, and the other one could be substituted altogether by a mix of trips using active and public transport, like walking, riding and rolling.""Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume.WatchDuration: 4 minutes 26 seconds4m 26s0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemSeek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00  Electric Vehicle Council welcomes introduction of fuel standards'A snowflake's hope in hell'Public transport usage sits at about 14 per cent nationally, but that figure is much lower in regional areas.Gold Coast public transportAre tax incentives the real reason you won't catch a bus to work?

A trove of government documents reveals the view from Wellington as NZ’s biggest city was drenched by a record amount of rain on January 27, and the clash over school closures. Investigations Editor ALEX SPENCE
reports.
Days after Auckland was devastated by an unprecedented downpour in late January, officials at the city’s emergency management agency were struggling to cope with the aftermath of the disaster.In Wellington, that was causing frustration at New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), according to a trove of government documents obtained under the Official Information Act.“There are fundamentals not being worked through, they are struggling to get head above water,” NEMA’s acting director Roger Ball told colleagues in one email obtained by the Herald.Local authorities had been heavily criticised for poor communication while a record amount of rain drenched Auckland on Friday January 27. Now, several days later, they were still not in command of the situation as the city moved into a recovery phase.Start your day in the knowGet the latest headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

That review found that the Auckland authorities were poorly prepared for a disaster of such magnitude and criticised senior city leaders for not publicly taking control.They also show that NEMA, central government departments, and ministers in Wellington, were caught out by the unexpected deluge in New Zealand’s biggest city, not just the Auckland authorities.NEMA’s director emergency management John Price told the Herald in a statement that the agency is currently undertaking an internal review of its role and actions in the response and early recovery phases of the Auckland floods and Cyclone Gabrielle, which devastated parts of the North Island less than a fortnight later.Price said NEMA will make these findings public when the review is complete but did not say when that is expected to happen.According to the documents obtained by the Herald, NEMA circulated an intelligence briefing at around 8am on Friday January 27 warning that the Auckland region would be hit by severe weather. However, the weather forecasts did not predict anywhere near the amount of rainfall that would hit the city that day.Late that Friday afternoon, ministers and staff in the Beehive began to realise that the deluge was much worse than expected.Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, centre, and emergency minister Kieran McAnulty are briefed on the Auckland floods. Photo / Dean PurcellAt 4.23pm, emergency minister Kieran McAnulty told his ministerial staff that he was fielding inquiries from Auckland MPs about the government’s response. The Prime Minister’s office was also receiving a flurry of messages.Officials scrambled to get a detailed picture of what was happening on the ground in Auckland. A group of senior staff shared updates in a private group on Signal, an encrypted messaging app used by journalists, activists, and whistleblowers to communicate secretly.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.But the Wellington officials’ knowledge was dependent on their counterparts in Auckland who were struggling to get on top of the disaster, the documents show.Ministers were frustrated by the lack of information. McAnulty complained to his adviser at one point that he needed more regular updates from NEMA, according to a timeline prepared by his office.At 10.20pm, McAnulty told NEMA’s acting director that he and Prime Minister Chris Hipkins were “receiving significant volumes of queries” and needed regular updates through the night.“Making sense of the situation in Auckland has been very challenging for us all,” Dave Gawn, NEMA’s chief executive, acknowledged in one email on Sunday 29 January. “We have flown up a liaison team to assist us in this.”On Monday 30 January, NEMA asked a senior national security staffer at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) to set up a “watch group” of senior government officials to guide the rescue and recovery efforts.“There are a range of challenges as we move into recovery,” a senior adviser at NEMA told DPMC. “As you’ll have seen, there have been challenges with ensuring the public have the information they need. We’re expecting there to be a review (done nationally, as well as one by Auckland Emergency Management).”In response, DPMC activated the Officials Committee for Domestic and External Security Coordination (pronounced “O-desk”), a committee of top government executives that convenes at moments of national crisis, such as the Christchurch earthquakes and the 2019 mosque killings.Other email exchanges show that NEMA pushed Auckland Council executives to move faster to implement crucial processes.It was “critically important” that the council urgently set up a mayoral relief fund and begin advertising it to collect donations for people affected by the flooding, a NEMA official said on Monday January 30. “Really important you harness the generosity of the public as quickly as possible.”The council also needed to urgently address a backlog of hundreds of requests for welfare needs assessments that were piling up in an email inbox, the official said.“It is clear that with this event a number of challenges have arisen that I believe require a more in-depth review than our [business as usual] debrief process provides,” the NEMA official said.In response, Gawn told colleagues he had raised the issues directly with Auckland Council chief executive Jim Stabback.Gawn said he had suggested to Stabback that he “cast his eyes over” a 2018 report which made recommendations about the city’s flawed handling of a previous storm.“Jim thinks they have the mayoral relief fund in hand,” Gawn said. “Took on board the other points and will look into the backlog of welfare needs requests tonight.”NEMA director Roger Ball providing an update after a previous natural disaster in 2021. Photo / Mark MitchellBall, the acting director, replied that he had just had a meeting with council executives where he also pressed NEMA’s concerns.“I have raised some basic structure and process issues: rosters, fatigue, forward planning, overnight activation for next rainband,” Ball told his colleagues. “There are fundamentals not being worked through, they are struggling to get head above water. I’ve asked they push for more… staff urgently.”The documents also show that government officials in Wellington spent days trying to clean up another internal communications mix-up, relating to the abrupt decision to close Auckland schools for a week.The direction by the Ministry of Education late on Monday January 30 — ordering schools and other educational institutions to stay closed until after Waitangi Day, to relieve pressure on Auckland roads — caused widespread confusion, partly because an IT error resulted in the email going to only half of school principals.Act leader David Seymour attacked the move at the time as “dictatorial, impractical, and infuriating” and National’s Christopher Luxon said it was “absolutely shambolic”.Documents reveal that the fallout triggered several days of back-and-forth between officials in various departments about who was responsible for the decision.The prospect of closing schools to relieve pressure on the city’s transport network was raised at a meeting involving the Prime Minister at around lunchtime on that Monday, the documents show.According to one account, Hipkins was sympathetic to the idea and said he would discuss it with Education Minister Jan Tinetti.Several hours later, the Ministry of Education sent the communication to schools ordering them to close for the rest of the week, stating that NEMA had “asked us to take action to help minimise traffic movement on Auckland roads while vital infrastructure is urgently repaired”.But that prompted pushback from NEMA and Auckland Council, which insisted they had not explicitly asked for schools to be closed.“We need to get this narrative corrected with MOE,” Ball told his colleagues at NEMA on that Monday night, “they have it completely wrong”.In an email to education secretary Iona Holsted, an aide to Mayor Wayne Brown said the mayor had been blindsided by the decision to close schools.Brown had been verbally advised by Auckland Transport on Monday morning that the transport network could cope if businesses and education providers remained open, the aide said.“The Mayor and his office had in mind some type of advice to Boards of Trustees and other employees,” they added. “He had not been advised that consideration was being given to closing [early childhood education] centres, schools and tertiary institutions until after Waitangi Day.”Holsted accepted that the decision rested with her. On Wednesday February 1, the ministry reversed its position and told schools they could open the next day.NEMA said in a statement that it recognised the “remarkable efforts” of emergency management staff around the country in responding to recent severe weather events, and that they will work together to make the system more resilient for future disasters.“We note that the challenges faced during these severe weather events, such as situational awareness and workforce constraints, are challenges that the emergency management system has faced for some time, and is working to remedy,” Price said.Stabback, the Auckland Council chief executive, said: “We cannot ignore the fact that this event was unprecedented... And we know we were not as well prepared for it as we could have been.” The council has accepted Bush’s recommendations and is “absolutely committed to ensuring Aucklanders are prepared for an emergency and being ready to respond when the worst happens”.Auckland Emergency Management took immediate remedial action after a “hot” debrief of its response in early March and is working on making longer-term changes. Those improvements were evident during Cyclone Gabrielle and in response to a sudden heavy downpour in May, the council said.Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

I think we’ve all got principles, which tend to flex when we’re asked to alter our lives for them: like a vegan sneaking a cheeky chicken parmesan when no
one’s looking.
For me, I believe human-caused climate change is an existential threat towards our continued existence as a species and we need quick and radical reform to stop the worst effects of what’s already happening.But that belief runs up against my love for cars.I’ve been a car guy since my nana gave me a VHS tape with an episode of Top Gear recorded onto it.Start your day in the knowGet the latest headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates. You can stop these at any time.Email addressSign UpBy signing up for this newsletter, you agree to NZME’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.However, behind my passion is the nagging knowledge that not only will fossil fuel cars have to go away but for the overall health of the world, phasing them out should have started decades ago.I could just say “No ethical consumption under capitalism”, blow a raspberry and keep on driving - but this phrase always feels like a cop-out people say when their beliefs run up against a wall of convenience.Recently though, my hand has been somewhat forced into a change, as I’ve had to start cycling to work.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.I used to bike to school every day after my mum and sister refused to stop playing the soundtrack to Mamma Mia! on car rides, and getting back into it as an adult has reminded me why I loved it so much.The feeling of peace for one, a bit of time to get my thoughts in order for the day without the rude interruption of Meryl Streep crooning Money, Money, Money.Taking a slower mode of transport to work lets you soak in the early morning visuals too, the glassy surface of the awa (river) and the sunrise making the sky look like an oil painting.Exercise also wakes me up, and as a person who doesn’t drink coffee, it means I’m a little less zombified in the morning, to the relief of my co-workers I’m sure.Read MoreFinn Williams: I’m a Kiwi but people think I sound ...Climate change agriculture emissions: Government looks ...The Front Page: Adaptation vs mitigation – What should ...Climate change: NZ could face $24 billion bill to hit ...Climate change: Simon Wilson - Christopher Luxon gets ...Climate change: NZ Steel to transition away from burning ...So it’s been a move for good for me, my bank account and the planet in a micro-sense, but it has also come with the confirmation of how I could have been doing this from day one.I’ve known the distance between home and work doesn’t justify a car ride, but the pull of convenience was just too strong.However, it’s also given me some ideas on how we can make our cities less reliant on the internal combustion engine - and it all revolves around that word again: convenience.I think most people drive to work not because it’s the cheapest or safest or least stressful option, because clearly it isn’t.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Rather, it’s the most convenient, because we’ve constructed our society in a way where cars appear to be the dominant species.So while making those cars powered by electricity instead of dinosaur juice is a good start, if we want to truly change things, we should look past individual change and look for ways to make environmentally-friendly transport easier for everyone to access.Some of these will require large amounts of political effort, but other ways could be implemented relatively quickly, like making bike lanes wider and safer so it doesn’t feel like you’re about to get splattered across the tarmac by some jacked-up monstrosity the moment you roll onto the road.Providing better infrastructure for bikes, like more bike racks - especially in busy places like shopping centres - would be a great help.Why not go even further and introduce something like the Clean Car Rebate for bikes? Because they’re as green as you can get for transportation, the only emissions that come from me cycling are sweat and swears directed at ute and SUV drivers acting like they own the road.While some of these changes could come quickly, I doubt they’d come easy, especially with the reality-averse pockets in our society, but good things don’t usually come easy - and the more we do something, the easier it gets - whether it’s cycling to work, or reestablishing the country’s rail network.Maybe if this happens I could keep my car too, though I promise I’d only use it for special occasions.Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Photo / APEarth has pushed past seven out of eight scientifically established safety limits and into “the danger zone”, not just for an overheating planet that’s losing its natural areas, but for the wellbeing of people living on it, according to a new study.The study looks not just at guardrails for the planetary ecosystem but for the first time, it includes measures of “justice,” which is mostly about preventing harm to countries, ethnicities and genders.The study by the international scientist group Earth Commission published in Wednesday’s journal Nature looks at climate, air pollution, phosphorus and nitrogen contamination of water from fertilizer overuse, groundwater supplies, fresh surface water, the unbuilt natural environment and the overall natural and human-built environment. Only air pollution wasn’t quite at the danger point globally.Air pollution is dangerous at local and regional levels, while the climate was beyond the harmful levels for humans in groups but not quite past the safety guideline for the planet as a system, the study from the Swedish group said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The study found “hotspots” of problem areas throughout Eastern Europe, South Asia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, parts of Africa and much of Brazil, Mexico, China and some of the US West — much of it from climate change. About two-thirds of Earth don’t meet the criteria for freshwater safety, scientists said as an example.Villagers gather during a visit by United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, in the village of Lomoputh in northern Kenya. Photo / AP“We are in a danger zone for most of the Earth system boundaries,” said study co-author Kristie Ebi, a professor of climate and public health at the University of Washington.If planet Earth just got an annual checkup, similar to a person’s physical, “our doctor would say that the Earth is really quite sick right now and it is sick in terms of many different areas or systems and this sickness is also affecting the people living on Earth”, Earth Commission co-chair Joyeeta Gupta, a professor of environment at the University of Amsterdam, said at a press conference.It’s not a terminal diagnosis. The planet can recover if it changes, including its use of coal, oil and natural gas and the way it treats the land and water, the scientists said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.But “we are moving in the wrong direction on basically all of these”, said study lead author Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.Plastic bottles, wooden planks, rusty barrels and other garbage clogging the Drina river near the eastern Bosnian town of Visegrad, Bosnia. Photo / AP“This is a compelling and provocative paper – scientifically sound in methodology and important for identifying the dimensions in which the planet is nearing the edge of boundaries that would launch us into irreversible states,” Indy Burke, dean of the Yale School of the Environment said in an email. She wasn’t part of the study.The team of about 40 scientists created quantifiable boundaries for each environmental category, both for what’s safe for the planet and for the point at which it becomes harmful for groups of people, which the researchers termed a justice issue.Rockstrom said he thinks of those points as setting up “a safety fence” outside of which the risks become higher, but not necessarily fatal.Rockstrom and other scientists have attempted in the past this type of holistic measuring of Earth’s various interlocking ecosystems. The big difference in this attempt is that scientists also looked at local and regional levels and they added the element of justice.Charred trees stand as a forest fire sweeps through part of Brazil's Amazon. Photo / APThe justice part includes fairness between young and old generations, different nations and even different species. Frequently, it applies to conditions that harm people more than the planet.An example of that is climate change.The report uses the same boundary of 1.5C of warming since pre-industrial times that international leaders agreed upon in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The world has so far warmed about 1.1C, so it hasn’t crossed that safety fence, Rockstrom and Gupta said, but that doesn’t mean people aren’t being hurt.“What we are trying to show through our paper is that even at 1 degree Centigrade there is a huge amount of damage taking place,” Gupta said, pointing to tens of millions of people exposed to extremely hot temperatures.The planetary safety guardrail of 1.5C hasn’t been breached, but the “just” boundary where people are hurt of 1C has been.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Read MoreClimate change agriculture emissions: Government looks ...Climate change: NZ could face $24 billion bill to hit ...Cyclone Gabrielle: How did climate change worsen our ...Climate change: Simon Wilson - Christopher Luxon gets ...Climate change: NZ Steel to transition away from burning ...“Sustainability and justice are inseparable,” said Stanford environmental studies chief Chris Field, who wasn’t part of the research. He said he would want even more stringent boundaries. “Unsafe conditions do not need to cover a large fraction of Earth’s area to be unacceptable, especially if the unsafe conditions are concentrated in and near poor and vulnerable communities.”Another outside expert, Dr Lynn Goldman, an environmental health professor and dean of George Washington University’s public health school, said the study was “kind of bold,” but she wasn’t optimistic that it would result in many actions.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from WorldPremiumWorldA British reporter had a big #MeToo scoop.

Photo / Mark MitchellNew Zealand is the first country in the world to try to put a price on agricultural emissions. Photo / Mark MitchellThe Government has not ruled out a fertiliser tax as an interim funding measure while the agriculture sector continues to work out how best to price its greenhouse gas emissions.“The generosity of the taxpayer can’t continue forever,” Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said today.It comes as time runs low on final decisions to be made on agricultural emissions pricing before Parliament’s last sitting day on August 31.In December, the Government responded to outcry from farmers at an earlier proposal to price agricultural emissions and said final decisions would be made and legislation introduced by the middle of this year. That policy was drawn up on the back of the He Waka Eke Noa sector-led agricultural emissions pricing proposal.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The clock is ticking down not only to the election but also to 2025, when agriculture would enter the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) if no agreement on an alternative method of pricing is reached.O’Connor told the Herald it was still the Government’s intention to have an emissions pricing plan ready before Parliament wrapped up before the last sitting day but they were also considering other interim options that would raise funds for research and development.He confirmed he had discussions with the sector about a fertiliser levy, which they said they did not want.A levy would have applied per tonne of fertiliser, of which farmers use over 400,000 tonnes of a year.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“The idea of a levy that would have contributed to money for research and development was my idea of a possible good investment,” O’Connor said in response to questions from Act’s Mark Cameron in the House.“The industry leaders have come back to me and said they don’t like that.“We now have to sit down and work on the best way forward of following through with He Waka Eke Noa, but dealing with the dilemma that they don’t want to pay anything until they’ve worked out the full analysis of sequestration options.“That will take some time. It will take more research and development. The issue is who will pay for that.”The confirmation came after sector lobby group Beef + Lamb chair Kate Acland told The Country last week the Government was considering such a levy, which was also reported by Politik today.Climate Change Minister James Shaw told the Herald it was “very unlikely” legislation around pricing emissions would be in place before the election so they were looking at other interim options.“We haven’t ruled anything out. And we’re constantly talking to the sector about what the options are.“There are a lot of calls from the sector to delay the introduction of the pricing scheme.“But I think there is an expectation that the sector should be paying for its emissions somehow, from New Zealand society, and from every other sector of the economy that already does pay for their emissions.”As part of global efforts to keep global warming below 1.5C, the Government has committed to a 10 per cent reduction in methane emissions from agriculture and landfills by 2030, going up to a 24-47 per cent reduction by 2050, compared to 2017 levels. It comes alongside a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.A key plank in accounting for and bringing down carbon emissions is the Emissions Trading Scheme. This requires polluters to purchase carbon credits for each tonne of emissions they produce.The scheme, introduced in 2008, included a carve-out for agriculture, which acknowledged the fact mitigation and offsetting of carbon was much simpler than for gases such as biogenic methane emitted from livestock (mainly cow and sheep burps) and nitrous oxide (fertiliser and excrement).The industry-led He Waka Eke Noa seeks to develop a separate “split-gas” pricing scheme for agriculture, which would be the first in the world, but negotiations on this have stalled after the Government last year rejected their proposal.Read MoreExplained: How the Govt wants to price farm emissions ...Govt promises ‘lowest possible’ farming emissions levy ...Labour and Greens may take agricultural emissions deal ...Why Māori are likely to be disadvantaged by agriculture ...Farm emissions scheme: Federated Farmers condemns Government's ...Greenpeace sceptical as Government signs deal with ...While the Government tilted in the direction of the He Waka Eke Noa group, deciding to set the levy at the lowest possible price to reduce emissions, parts of the farming sector were unhappy with the rules around sequestration.Contention also remains over that price within the Government and between the Government and the agricultural sector.In December, the Government said it would look at broadening what would qualify as sequestration under the scheme, allowing farmers to get credits for more of their sequestration efforts.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The National Party supports a form of emissions pricing to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, and previously said it was leaning closer towards the He Waka Eke Noa position.National Party agriculture spokesperson Todd McClay today told the Herald the party would be unveiling its emissions pricing proposal within the next month.He said the He Waka Eke Noa process was “close to being over”, which he blamed on the Government rejecting their proposal last year.He said National would not support a fertiliser levy, which he said would increase food prices. He would not give anything away about its proposal but said its main principles were to not push production offshore and to provide farmers options other than destocking.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from PoliticsPolitics‘Red tape police’: Act hopes to ditch excess regulation03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsWill it be Paula Bennett v Wayne Brown for Auckland mayor in 2025?03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsClaire Trevett: Backtracks and attack tactics make for messy week in politics02 Jun 06:00 PMPoliticsAct to continue mission to double its vote in 2023 election at annual conference02 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Photo / Glenys Rogers, FileWild horses graze in front of a forest block at Hukatere on the Aupouri Peninsula in the Far North. Photo / Glenys Rogers, FileOPINIONThe Climate Emergency Response Fund, CERF, played a conspicuous role in the narrative around this year’s budget. It is a multi-year fund that receives money from the NZ emissions trading scheme, ETS.
Treasury says
the ETS revenue has fallen dramatically, forecast to be a loss of $2.7 billion. This is a consequence of Labour’s reluctance to allow the ETS price to rise. This money is used to fund carbon mitigation initiatives - a host of which have been dubious.
An obvious example is the clean car discount scheme that offers a subsidy to purchasers of expensive electric cars. It should not be a shock to know this hustle has been oversubscribed.It does not assist working-class whānau or rural residents. It is a subsidy to those who can already afford electric cars. Meanwhile, firms in fisheries, farming, and forestry pay an ever-increasing tax when their new diesel vehicles are imported.Keep up with the latest Kāhu newsMāori stories from our newsrooms across Aotearoa, straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

Before the bureaucracy funds any more charging stations here, they will need to substantially invest in roading resilience.Officials survey the damage to SH1 at Mangamuka Gorge in the Far North after recent storms. Photo / Mjanne Jensen, File As rural Māori seek to expand their investments within marine farming and other primary sectors, crumbling infrastructure is a major barrier to growth. A major reset is needed to ensure flooding resilience and highway accessibility. If not, our overseas revenue will be significantly harmed.As an example of this, fresh oysters from Whangaroa can fetch up to $35 a dozen in Asian markets. Unreliable transport, however, means that this opportunity goes begging. Not unlike rural communities pleading for Waka Kotahi to fix the potholes.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Apparently, a multi-billion fund for transport has been set aside in the budget. However, given the ongoing drive to build light rail in Auckland, the whānau in the sticks could be hitchhiking before the money seeps north.Within our Te Aupouri tribal estate, there is considerable scope to boost the amount of renewable energy. Solar farms, generally driven by middlemen, are regularly pitched. Such initiatives however often flounder because our Māori land is not proximate to the main grid and there is limited transmission capacity.Related articlesNew Zealand'It's the economy, stupid'25 May 11:56 PMNew ZealandChristine Fletcher: The air pocket in Auckland Airport share sale25 May 06:00 PMNew ZealandKerry Worsnop: Still no reply to failed 111 cyclone calls25 May 06:00 PMNew ZealandFuture of education: Why NZ needs to be there first24 May 06:00 PMTo date, CERF funding has not gone on such initiatives to boost Māori involvement in climate mitigation. The Ministry for the Environment is supposed to give weight to te ao Māori perspectives as such money is allocated. Unfortunately, the ministry approach is airy and rural whānau dismiss it as globetrotting gas.Now the ETS has fallen within the crosshairs of the Climate Commission and the chairman Rod Carr, also a member of the UN global climate experts group formed at COP26 in Glasgow.Domestically, he is opposed to industries using ETS-based offsetting. His view appears to have infected the work of these global busybodies. In giving feedback on his UN trip, he described offsetting as a “veil of virtue” designed to prolong emissions.Fortunately, such thinking is not in charge of local climate policy-making. Such responsibilities properly belong within ourselves. We are a sovereign nation that should seek out the most efficient manner of addressing decarbonisation.The vast majority of Māori climate commentary coming from the Government overlooks least-cost options. It is almost as if commercial analysis is a swear word. But such an attitude does not pay tribal bills.During the upcoming election, rural Māori primary producers will need to remind candidates that cost implications do not vanish just because someone mentions Papatūānuku.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Te Aupouri has received land, fisheries quota and forestry interests through the settlement process. Such an endowment of assets means cost-efficiency is essential to our role in the zero-emissions journey.Penetaui Kleskovic. Photo / Supplied, FileThe durability of our settlement will be undermined if the Ministry for Environment heeds only politically-palatable voices.The ETS is actually a regulated market. For those willing to invest in carbon forestry on marginal blocks of land, ETS certainty is critical. It enables owners to earn income from idle land. Revenue from such an operation can then be directed to fresh Māori ventures.Unfortunately, the opponents to offsetting are bent on disruption. As the Climate Minister blows hot and cold on the future of Māori carbon farming, investment slows down.Ideally, adjustments to the rules around Māori land and the ETS ought to have been developed collaboratively. This opportunity has been scorned by the bureaucracy and litigation cannot be ruled out.Labour Cabinet Ministers should be seeing red. They ought to remember, 45 years on from the Bastion Point, Māori land rights remain potent.Such concerns may be dismissed by Rod Carr and the Greens co-leader James Shaw.However, in about 120 days, voting for the parliamentary elections will commence. With a change of government, the chairman of the Climate Change Commission may be leaving the position early.So too might others as the climate in the regional Māori constituency heats up.- Penetaui Kleskovic is operations manager at Te Aupouri Commercial Development.Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

It was late enough to be considered early by some – the sun wasn’t up yet, but it would be soon. I was drinking at a dive in New Orleans when a beat-up sedan
cruised past, slowed down, drove back around the block and produced from the driver’s window a small black pistol.
The barman was quick to react. He launched himself over the bar with practised speed and stood defiantly in the double-wide doorway, shouting, “Not today! Not this bar!” Behind him, another bartender, a minute earlier off shift and enjoying a beer, rushed to the backroom and returned with a gun of his own. The car drove off.Walking this time, my new hero returned to his spot behind the bar. He took a quick swig of beer and sighed, “Another night on Bourbon.” A punter raised his glass and we all took a drink.I thought maybe it was about time I called it a night.Start your day in the knowGet the latest headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates. You can stop these at any time.Email addressSign UpBy signing up for this newsletter, you agree to NZME’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.The background: at the start of this month I road-tripped with a few of my best mates from Houston to New Orleans and back again, stopping off at Little Rock, Memphis and Nashville along the way. We had the time of our lives. Most of all, though, I’ll never forget that moment on Bourbon Street.What I recall most strongly – hazy as the memory may be – is not the obvious and shocking violence of the situation. It’s how quickly the scene returned to normal, how thoroughly unfazed everyone seemed to be.Read MoreShane Te Pou: Budget 2023 shows a Government that delivers ...Shane Te Pou: If not Christopher Luxon, could Shane ...Shane Te Pou: Meka Whaitiri left Labour for Te Pati ...Shane Te Pou: Road deaths are lower since Road to Zero ...I had witnessed first-hand the effects of the collective trauma of gun violence in the United States. Pulling a gun wasn’t surprising enough to disrupt service longer than it takes for someone’s whiskey to get warm.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The takeaway for me is this: people are brave, and we’re resilient. We’re also directly subject to the consequences of political inaction and perhaps too quick to accept this into our lives.I thought of Cyclone Gabrielle and the seemingly endless list of recent extreme weather events at home and around the world. Just as the persistent and universal threat of gun violence exists for everyday Americans, so does the threat of climate change – but for all of us. They both demand bold political action, across the aisle.I don’t want to see a world in which we would sooner raise a toast to a brave barman than limit widespread access to deadly weaponry. By the same token, I don’t want to see one in which we get better at putting up sandbags before meaningfully tackling the ever-present issue of climate change.It was famously said that “Politics is the art of the possible” and I understand that Labour’s latest Budget was a bread-and-butter Budget. Cost of living was the focus and justifiably so. I am concerned, though, about the future of our spending on climate policies.Cutting funding to the Climate Emergency Response Fund, in light of our slowness to adopt official advice from the Climate Change Commission on emission trading price controls, seems near-sighted and reckless. Similarly, offering half-price fares on public transport doesn’t address the infrastructural issues behind low public transport usage. The expansion of the Warmer Kiwi Homes project is promising but, to borrow from Paul Eagle, “a drop in the bucket”.Real investment now in effective climate policies will pay off in spades down the track.More people taking buses and living in warm, dry homes will drastically reduce not just our footprint but our day-to-day expenditure, putting more money in the back pockets of kaimahi and in government coffers.National’s agitating for tax cuts, clearly designed to benefit the wealthy, is not the answer. We need an emboldened Labour with a focus on a future-proofed Aotearoa and a firm understanding of what climate change will mean for our communities. I can only hope this view is shared by New Zealanders when we go to the polls in October.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Another memory sticks out from my trip: I had a perfect barbershop experience in Nashville. Randy had been cutting hair in Music City for 40 years and took over from his father, for whom the barbershop was named. He didn’t ask me what I wanted; I sat down, he started cutting, and we got to talking.We connected on a lot – cost of living, mismanaged natural disaster recoveries, the issue of gun violence – but we disagreed on a lot, too. It was a classic, friendly left-vs-right argument. The tone changed, though, when we discussed our hometowns. We talked about the types of trees, what a summer day felt like, and what we eat when we get together.Our love for our communities was proud and it was shared. It was inarguable that we shouldn’t invest in their safety and future. Some issues, it remains, are bigger than politics.Here is to Darcy, Greg and Jamie.

Photo / Warren BucklandMinistry for the Environment chief executive James Palmer flies between Hawke’s Bay and Wellington about once a week. Photo / Warren BucklandThe chief executive of the Ministry for the Environment has come under fire for flying to Wellington once a week from his home in Hawke’s Bay while the ministry advises New Zealanders to reduce the number of flights they’re taking to reduce emissions.The Herald can reveal that the ministry’s newly appointed chief executive and secretary, James Palmer, is regularly travelling by air for his role, in which he advises Government on environmental policy.Documents released under the Official Information Act show Palmer travels between Hawke’s Bay and Wellington about once a week at his personal expense, mostly by air and sometimes by electric vehicle.The Ministry for the Environment (MfE) said Palmer stood by his regular air travel as he offset the emissions he was creating.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“It is not the ministry’s position that New Zealanders should stop air travel. Many New Zealanders with national roles travel regularly.“Mr Palmer carefully weighed this before accepting his leadership role at the ministry. He considers the emissions from his personal travel to be an acceptable impact, after being offset through native afforestation credits, to enable him to apply his skills and experience to the national challenges of climate change, resource management and freshwater reforms.”The carbon footprint of a roundtrip from Napier to Wellington produces 70 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions over a distance of 540 kilometres, according to Air New Zealand’s calculator.Palmer’s travel emissions are not included in the company emissions listed on the ministry’s website because he pays for them himself.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Palmer has been appointed for five years, from March 1 this year, and is unable to move to Wellington full time because of “family commitments and responsibilities”.Act Party climate change spokesman Simon Court accused Palmer of hypocrisy.“If bureaucrats are going to lecture Kiwis, they should lead by example. Instead, they tell us what to do while flying and driving around the country.“This is next-level hypocrisy.”The ministry was criticised earlier this year for spending $913,000 on flights over 11 months while advising the public on its website to “walk, cycle or take public transport wherever possible”.It spent a further $97,225 on taxis, shuttles and Ubers, with only $251 being spent on public transport.New Zealand’s aviation emissions are under the spotlight after a new paper published yesterday highlighted that they were particularly high and were on a rapid growth path that was incompatible with the Paris Agreement on climate change.None of New Zealand’s current efforts against carbon emissions were strong enough, given its ranking as fourth-worst in the world for domestic aviation emissions, it said. 350 Aotearoa climate campaigner Adam Currie said the ministry was not doing what was needed to cut climate pollution.“The real issue here is not one man’s flights – it’s MfE’s utter failure to boldly address the climate crisis with the depth and urgency required.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“MfE needs to be pulling all the meaningful levers it has on climate, hard.“This also shows the need for investment in low-carbon, regional trains that get us around to where we live, work and play.”The ministry’s website acknowledges its main source of emissions is air travel and says it has prioritised this as a focus area for organisational emissions reductions.It had spent $1685.22 excluding GST on flights for Palmer as of May 1 – not including his personal travel from Hawke’s Bay to Wellington.Environment Minister David Parker would not comment on the matter.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Photo / Leigh Torres, Oregon State UniversityThey’ve melted glaciers, energised storms, driven tropical fish into colder climes and helped fuel a run of record-warm temperatures.Now, the marine heatwaves which have engulfed New Zealand over recent years have been shown to disrupt local feeding and breeding of our own population of the planet’s largest animal: the blue whale.The big mammals have long captured imaginations for their huge size - adults are known to grow to well over 20 metres.It wasn’t until 2018 that scientists revealed the South Taranaki Bight was home to a group genetically distinct from others in the Pacific and Southern oceans.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Soon after, researchers found how links between the whales, their prey and ocean conditions were gradually changing on a warming planet.Those concerns have only deepened with a new study revealing the dramatic ramifications of abnormally warm seas for the ocean giants, the sounds of which were captured by seafloor-mounted hydrophones over two years.“For blue whales, like many marine organisms, sound is critically important,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Dawn Barlow of Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute.The species are known to produce two distinct types of vocalisations: song, which is used by males and thought to play a role in breeding behaviour, and “D calls”, which are used by both sexes and linked with feeding.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Their recordings captured these sounds every day of the year – if not every hour – and showed them following seasonal patterns.D calls were associated with upwelling conditions, when cold, nutrient-rich waters drove ocean productivity and led to aggregations of krill – the blue whales’ main food source.Barlow said that added to evidence this call was related to feeding.A pair of blue whales come up for air in the South Taranaki Bight. Photo / Leigh Torres, Oregon State University“In contrast, blue whale song showed a very clear seasonal peak in autumn, and was less obviously correlated with environmental conditions.”To explore the hypothesised function of song as a breeding call, the researchers turned to a perhaps more obscure source of information: historical whaling records.“Whenever a pregnant whale was killed during commercial whaling operations, the length of the foetus was measured,” Barlow explained.“By looking at the seasonal pattern in these foetal lengths in the Southern Hemisphere, we can presume that births occur around the time of year when foetal lengths are at their longest.”The records indicated this was from April to May.“By back-calculating the 11-month gestation time for a blue whale, we can presume that mating occurs generally in May to June, which is the exact time of the peak in song intensity from our recordings.”While the researchers had set out to investigate habitat use patterns in the region, they hadn’t anticipated that something else would shift their focus.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“When marine heatwaves swept through the South Taranaki Bight, with cascading effects across the ecosystem, we had no choice.”The impact on blue whales could be clearly observed.“We found that during marine heatwaves, when water temperatures were particularly warm, D calls were dramatically reduced compared to during productive upwelling conditions,” Barlow said.“During the fall breeding peak, song intensity was likewise dramatically reduced following the marine heatwave.”A blue whale mother and calf come up for air in the South Taranaki Bight, with the South Island in view. Photo / Dawn Barlow, Oregon State UniversityThis suggested that, following poor feeding conditions, blue whales might put less effort into reproduction.“Our finding that D calls were reduced during marine heatwaves fits with what we would expect: anomalously warm conditions seemed to reduce the food resources available to the blue whales,” Barlow said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“But what really surprised us was the relationship between marine heatwaves and lower song intensity during the breeding season.“Essentially, we were seeing evidence for reduced reproductive effort following marine heatwave events.”Study senior author Dr Leigh Torres said the research team was now interested in taking a deeper look at the health consequences for the species.“We want to know if and how changing ocean conditions, such as warmer temperatures, decrease the availability and quality of prey for blue whales,” she said.“And then what the consequences of these changes in prey may mean for blue whale foraging behaviour, body condition and reproductivity rates.”Given marine heatwaves are predicted to become longer, stronger and more frequent around New Zealand, there was already enough cause for concern.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Blue whales are long-lived animals and seem to be able to adapt by perhaps putting less effort into reproduction during a particularly poor year for feeding, as we showed in our study,” Barlow said.“However, while they may have the flexibility and capacity to adapt for a year or two at a time, what will happen if and when these conditions become more frequent, as they are projected to do?”“The potential impacts are concerning, and how these blue whales and the ecosystem they rely on will fare in the future remains to be seen.”SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Home / New ZealandMonster avalanche triggered by extreme deluge raises new climate change questionsBy  Jamie Morton 25 May, 2023 04:55 AM5 mins to readSaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemailAn extreme winter storm at Aoraki-Mt Cook last July triggered one of the largest avalanche cycles observed in New Zealand in recent decades. This picture shows an avalanche that wiped out thousands of square metres of vegetation. Image / Department of ConservationAn extreme winter storm at Aoraki-Mt Cook last July triggered one of the largest avalanche cycles observed in New Zealand in recent decades. This picture shows an avalanche that wiped out thousands of square metres of vegetation. Image / Department of ConservationAn extreme winter rainstorm that triggered one of the largest avalanche cycles observed in decades has raised fresh questions about the risk of more of these hazardous events under climate change.Amid what was the country’s warmest and wettest winter to date, the storm that drenched the Southern Alps over July 18-19 last year was a stand-out.The 547mm of rain that dropped on the alps - over just a 72-hour period - was unprecedented in records stretching back to the 1920s.The deluge also happened to come at a time of year - and at elevations - where the mountains would’ve normally been receiving snow rather than torrential rain.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The dramatic result of hundreds of millimetres of rainfall on an above-average snowpack was the biggest avalanche observed in Aoraki Mount Cook National Park’s Kitchener Path in nearly 40 years.It surged down the mountain toward Aoraki/Mt Cook village, running along a diversion berm that’d been designed to protect the settlement against one-in-100-year avalanches, before wiping out nearly 9000sq m of vegetation.

When the weather cleared, residents could clearly see their village surrounded by massive avalanches that would have swept away anyone in their path – but the berm appeared to have stopped them causing more damage to the landscape.For Otago University researcher Aubrey Miller and his colleagues, the freak storm and avalanche left much to understand.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“The reason we wanted to study this event in detail is because it was an opportunity to look closely at an extreme event that many are worried may become more frequent or more likely in the future,” said Miller, a member of Otago’s Mountain Research Centre.“Significant rain typically is a concern for flooding - but the other hazards are important to understand as well, as this event showed.”Miller pointed out that avalanches themselves weren’t uncommon in New Zealand – hundreds were reported between 1999 and 2018 alone – nor were those triggered by “rain-on-snow” events.“But the timing of this July 2022 storm was unusual,” he said.Study co-author Todd Redpath, also of Otago University, said there’d been 16 instances of 24-hour rainfall exceeding 300mm at Mt Cook Village, but before this storm, all had been in the spring, summer or autumn months.Overseas, Miller said there was interest among scientists in the mechanics of heavy rain falling on snow – especially in areas, such as the European alps, where that was a rare but increasing occurrence under climate change.“If we can better understand the dynamics of the avalanches induced by extreme rain, then we can better anticipate future risks posed to people and infrastructure from extreme rain events falling on snow.”In their study, carried out in collaboration with the Department of Conservation, the research team used data from drone-mounted equipment to map the avalanche path at fine-scale resolution.They also used specially-developed modelling software to simulate and analyse the avalanche dynamics.Their findings, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, confirmed the largest avalanche cycle was the largest seen since at least 1986 – and that the Kitchener path and berm had performed as designed.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.They also found how a domino-like series of drivers had set up the historic surges.“The timing of the rain after a snowy start to the winter season, coupled with the intensity of the rain, saturated the snowpack to the point that a widespread mass-movement cycle developed,” Miller said.This image shows avalanche danger as it was forecast over mid-July 2022, when a major rainstorm hit the Southern Alps. Red denotes ""high"" danger, orange ""considerable"", and yellow ""moderate"". Photo / Supplied “While more than 370mm of rain fell in 24 hours, it took only around 100mm before the snow avalanche released.”Importantly, that suggested we may see other large avalanche cycles in future - even with slightly more modest storms, if the other driving factors line up.“In other words, the snowpack couldn’t contain more than 100mm of rain before releasing the large avalanches, in this case,” Miller said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“More research is needed on the exact timing and triggers for these rain-on-snow avalanches.“The fact the rain fell in mid-winter when the snowpack was less consolidated means it probably couldn’t withstand as much of the rain before releasing.”     Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 4:52Loaded: 0.00%0:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -4:52 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Tracken (Main), selectedFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Video / NZ HeraldNOW PLAYING • Focus: PM on major low emissions initiativeAnnouncement of major low emissions initiative with PM Chris Hipkins. Video / NZ HeraldBy RNZFonterra, one of the country’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, says it will be a decade before it will abandon coal altogether, and it wants more Government assistance.Last week New Zealand Steel said it would halve its coal use in 2027 after a Government boost to help cut coal-powered operations.NZ Steel will receive up to $140 million to create an electric arc furnace at its mill in Glenbrook, Auckland. The company said this would save cut 800,000 tonnes of carbon a year from day one.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Fonterra chief operating officer Fraser Whineray told RNZ that it was working to reduce emissions, but more Government assistance would help.“Between 2018 and 2030 we’ll be down 30 percent, which means [by 2030] coal will be down about 60 percent.”At the moment, for each tonne of greenhouse gases, the company must pay into the Government’s Emissions Trading Scheme, but Whineray said he would like to see more of that be given back to Fonterra to help it introduce more clean alternative energy sources.“Our total off-farm emissions in New Zealand at the moment is about 1.5 - 1.6 million tonnes [per year], and so you times that by the carbon price, and that’s roughly the cost of surrendering carbon for our emissions in New Zealand each year.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“We surrender more than $100 million in carbon credits each year for our off-farm emissions, and so we are talking with ECCA [the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority] about what can be done to use some of that for... decarbonisation.”Fonterra counted both its on-farm greenhouse gas emissions as well as the off-farm greenhouse gas emissions from the organisation.“On-farm emissions are about 10 times what Fonterra, the entity, emits. Our coal is about 800,000 tonnes of emissions [per year] at the moment... Coal is about half our farm emissions,” Whineray said.“The ETS is supposed to recycle funds back into decarbonisation. And if we’re spending more than $100 million a year on carbon credits, getting a little bit of that back to help pay for the actual projects - some of which we’ve got under way and some much larger ones in front of us, that sounds like a pretty reasonable starting point.”Read MoreCompetition in Waikato keeps Fonterra ‘sharp’ - NZ ...Fonterra maintenance team refuses to give thumbprints ...Delving for cream beneath the froth: New watchdog chair ...Fonterra’s first half profit jumps 50pc, doubles dividend ...So far Fonterra had received just under $3m in Government grants for two “relatively small” projects, Whineray said.“We’ve done some of the largest decarbonisation projects so far... and we’ve got three projects simultaneously under way at the moment.“Ultimately in the very long term we have to imagine a future without coal, gas and diesel.”The company was looking into a variety of types of clean energy to see what might work for them, Whineray said.“We’re looking at biomass which we’ve already installed, we’ve got projects at Stirling in Otago, the Stirling cheese factory there which turned on Tuesday, that’s now running on biomass.“You can use white pellets, which are a form of tricking an existing coal boiler into thinking it’s getting coal and that’s made of sawdust and things like that, and that’s at Te Awamutu, that’s our largest decarbonisation project to date. You can also look at black pellets. We did a trial with Genesis on that, which is great because you can store them outside.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.And they were considering new European heat pump technology that could use renewable energy in a much more energy-efficient way.“Obviously diesel - we’ve got our electric truck running around in the Waikato now and that’s part of a precursor to a larger look at our trucking fleet of 450.”Whineray said one key factor when considering how to power their operations was reliability and diversification to ensure resilience.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from BusinessPremiumBusinessUpdatedApple is stepping into the metaverse03 Jun 08:16 PMPremiumBusinessLiam Dann: Why NZ’s record migration gains won’t be an election issue03 Jun 06:01 PMBusinessWhy Sir Michael Hill sets his goals 30 years at a time03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumBusinessContact Energy backs geothermal in the race to decarbonise03 Jun 12:00 AM“Light at the end of tunnel for farms” sponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

a whopping $1520 every year because they bin uneaten food, which adds up to $3.1 billion worth of food wasted nationwide.
        Those numbers are staggering, and as food prices continue to climb, it’s a great time for people to make small changes that will save money and help the environment.Start your day in the knowGet the latest headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

If we’re always throwing out manky carrots at the end of the week, skip buying them for a while.Storing food properly is another, with veggies lasting longer if they’re put into an airtight container.Try hard to make the most out of food by using the ‘first in, first out’ rule. This means eating the oldest items before using newer ones.Read MoreCost of living crisis: Tauranga foodbank’s costs spiral, ...Cost of living: Rising costs hitting Tauranga families ...Cost of living: Top tips on how to get through this ...Cost of living crisis: New Zealand households wasting ...Knowing the difference between expiration dates and best-before dates is important too. Of course, if it smells rank, it’s probably best not to consume it.Meal kits are another great option because they’re delivered right to your door and come pre-portioned for your family size. Not only will you have exactly what you need, there’ll be no extra food going in the trash.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Composting food scraps is another simple process which is an effective way to combat food waste.Instead of throwing away leftover fruits, vegetables and other organic materials, they can be turned into nutrient-rich compost that can be used to nourish our gardens.At the end of the day, fighting food waste is something we can all do.By thinking about what we’re throwing out we can reduce our food waste, reduce our costs and create a greener future that’s better for everyone.Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

As
I watched a number of climate change initiatives tossed on that bonfire, I had to agree.
But credit where credit is due. Or perhaps that should be incentive where incentive is due.Make it your business to knowStart your day with the latest business headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates. You can stop these at any time.Email addressSign UpBy signing up for this newsletter, you agree to NZME’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.The $140 million your government has committed to assisting New Zealand Steel’s partial conversion to electric furnaces - along with the $100 million hydrogen rebate that could help accelerate the work that companies like The Richardson Group in Invercargill have started with their own $15 million investment in a hydrogen refuelling plant in Gore for its fleet of 1300 trucks - is an encouraging sign.Perhaps we are at last seeing politicians who recognise that industry is not the enemy.We are all in this together and, to a very large extent, what we are now dealing with are the unintended consequences of what we once viewed as advances in technologies and industries that would benefit us all.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Cars, plastics, air travel, more productive farms.I was born in 1950 and I remember marvelling at my first sight of an aeroplane. Or the arrival of electricity in a house where mum had cooked, for as long as I could remember, on a coal-fired range while I read Eagle comics by the light of a gas lamp.I could never have imagined that one day I would travel the globe in jet planes where the hundreds of thousands of miles I travelled each year, creating high-value jobs back in New Zealand, would add to a global threat called the greenhouse effect.I can also remember watching as the land around us, some of which my family owned small parcels of, as Māori land, were planted in pine forests because that was an intergenerational investment in our future.Fast forward to that future, and Cyclone Gabrielle.When we aren’t cordoning off huge tracts of productive land for trees that are part of an ETS scheme that can be viewed as little more than a financial instrument for overseas companies to buy and sell so they can delay real efforts to lower their carbon footprints, we are alternatively cutting down those trees and exporting them at somewhere between US$60 to US$80 a tonne.In a country where we are facing a significant housing shortage, it seems that exporting one of the least carbon-generating building materials available to us - concrete is one of the worst - makes very little sense, economically, environmentally or socially.But what makes even less sense is the waste this limited use of our forest resources generates, along with the damage it causes when events like Cyclone Gabrielle strike.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Your latest budget recognised that cost with the billions of dollars you have had to set aside to repair the damage caused, and to try to prepare and defend our communities against the increasing frequencies of events like Cyclone Gabrielle.The irony is that the waste, the slash, that caused so much of the damage is worth far more to our economy than the logs which we currently export overseas, and often import back as finished products.As the co-chair of an organisation called The NZ Product Accelerator, I have had the privilege of seeing the incredible work being done by scientists, working in conjunction with businesses that are moving to take advantage of the huge opportunities that global warming and sustainability offer us as a country.One of the most significant opportunities lies in the slash and waste that is a result of our current forestry practices that are focused, almost exclusively, on the export of logs.That opportunity lies in viewing a tree in its entirety, in utilising the whole tree and the residuals that come from it. The thinning, the pruning, the slash and waste left lying on the ground and, of course, the logs themselves.Then there’s the sawdust and wood chipping that is left over from wood manufacturing. I had never realised the huge value that can be extracted from turning this waste into high-value bioenergy, biomaterials and biochemicals. A scientist from the Scion Research Institute in Rotorua actually suggested that Aotearoa New Zealand could become the Saudi Arabia of biofuels.It’s a bold claim but these are the vision we need to pursue if we are to not only meet our carbon zero target, but to also create multi-billion dollar exports created from high-value jobs, in the regions, where we grow trees better than anyone else in the world.I was recently invited to a presentation made by global investors focused on the opportunities around the circular bio-economy, in particular around forests, here in Aotearoa. When I asked, why New Zealand, their answer was simple.“New Zealand is the brand.”We need to protect that brand - and seeing images of logs and slash destroying roads, bridges, power stations, homes, businesses and communities, is not something we should contemplate happening again.We need to be thinking differently. We need to incentivise the businesses that are already making inroads into creating a multi-billion dollar circular bio-economy that takes our slash and turns it into cash.Conservative estimates suggest that the trash we leave lying on the ground could be worth up to 40 times the value of those logs we export.I recall that when you became Prime Minister, in one of your first press conferences you said it was time to look forward, not back, and we needed to deal with the issues that faced us now.Read MoreForestry waste: Slashed - Government announces inquiry, ...Forestry waste: Overseas Investment Office probes East ...Forestry slash inquiry: Debris-battered East Coast ...East Coast forestry industry facing community revolt ...Well in the Māori worldview, there is a whakatauki, a proverb, that says “the footsteps we lay down in our past, create the paving stones on which we stand today”.And in that worldview, the footsteps we lay down are always in front of us. We have to learn from them. Our past has got to inform the solutions for the future.As a first step, we have to use those lessons to unite us and accept that we are all responsible for ensuring a better world for our tamariki, our children.I believe our parents, our grandparents, believed that was what they were doing when they planted those forests, when they bought their first car when they gave us our first plastic toys.Unintended consequences.Let’s not repeat them by yelling at each other, by blaming each other.The answers are there, but they will only be heard when we all choose to listen.Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from BusinessPremiumBusinessUpdatedApple is stepping into the metaverse03 Jun 08:16 PMPremiumBusinessLiam Dann: Why NZ’s record migration gains won’t be an election issue03 Jun 06:01 PMBusinessWhy Sir Michael Hill sets his goals 30 years at a time03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumBusinessContact Energy backs geothermal in the race to decarbonise03 Jun 12:00 AM“Light at the end of tunnel for farms” sponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Video / Newstalk ZB ...OPINIONDo you have gas? It’s a personal question that may cause offence – and not always for the obvious reason. Because the way we choose to cook or heat our homes is increasingly becoming something of a sore point.Since the Climate Change Commission issued draft advice recommending the banning of new gas installations by 2025, anyone with a gas hob or central heating has been put on notice.With the Government’s gas transition plan due for consultation this year, a long-term plan to phase out gas will require everyone affected to start thinking about the alternatives. But it may not be a simple transition. Moves to cancel the humble gas hob even ignited another culture war in the United States.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.On one side, some environmentalists and health researchers point to the role of gas in global warming and respiratory conditions like asthma. On the other, conservatives have called it another “woke” outrage. One celebrity chef even taped himself to a stove in protest.Nevertheless, New York recently became the first US state to ban new residential natural gas connections from 2026. This followed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which introduced financial incentives for homeowners to switch from gas to electricity.What are the arguments for a gas ban in Aotearoa New Zealand, then? Will it make a difference to our emissions profile? And are we likely to see something like the New York policy introduced?

Big change for minimal gain?First the good news. When burned efficiently, natural gas – the stuff that’s piped into your home if you’re on the mains – produces 40 per cent less carbon dioxide than coal, and 30 per cent less than oil.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The amount of contaminants it contains (such as mercury and sulphur dioxide) is insignificant. It creates no soot or dust, and emits minimal particulates when it’s burned. Overall, it’s among the cleanest of the fossil fuels.But natural gas is primarily methane – an active greenhouse gas which traps 86 times more atmospheric heat than the same amount of carbon dioxide over 20 years.A recent study of gas stoves in homes found the appliances can leak unburnt methane and nitrogen oxides even when turned off. This damages indoor air quality and creates more emissions than it saves in carbon dioxide from the cleaner burn.Given the country’s commitment under the Climate Change Response (Zero Emissions) Amendment Act to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below gross 2005 levels by 2030, the case against gas may seem clear. Just how urgent the situation is, however, is open to debate.As of 2017, New Zealand’s natural gas consumption was 0.1 per cent of the global total (putting us 55th in the world). Electricity and heat production accounted for 13 per cent of New Zealand’s gross carbon dioxide emissions in 2020, but domestic consumption of gas and production of CO₂ are relatively low.By contrast, agriculture-based emissions are very high. Livestock produced 90 per cent of gross methane emissions in 2020.With natural gas making up such a tiny portion of the country’s overall emissions, does ending home use really add up? Might a ban be seen as tokenism – or become the political hot potato it has in the US?Invest in alternatives firstIn the end, it’s about priorities. But it’s unlikely the supply of natural gas to New Zealand homes can end soon. The Climate Change Commission’s 2023 draft advice recommends the Government introduce “targeted support” to help lower-income households replace gas infrastructure (perhaps similar to what is proposed in the US).This in turn will require significant investment in the electricity sector first.

And it achieves only incremental change in the wider energy system. Given the marginal reduction in overall emissions from a move away from natural gas, reliable alternatives must be in place first.Grants to support individuals and communities looking to develop local micro-power generation (such as solar and wind turbines) will reduce demand on overstretched infrastructure. The same applies for hydrogen fuel cells for housing when these are launched commercially.We need to put the means to develop alternative sources of power in place first, then phase out natural gas.

Video / Newstalk ZB ...OPINIONChristopher Luxon is right! He says Government should not be paying multinational corporates to reduce their carbon emissions when they’re perfectly capable of doing it themselves.
But Luxon is also ridiculously wrong.
Here’s why.
NZ Steel, which is owned by the Australian company BlueScope, will receive up to $140 million from the Government to install an electric arc furnace at its Glenbrook plant. This will reduce its carbon emissions by 45 per cent.BlueScope made a record A$2.81 billion ($2.97b) profit last year. It doesn’t need the bribe. Sorry, subsidy.Make a beeline for the BeehiveGet weekly politics headlines with commentary from our political experts straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates. You can stop these at any time.Email addressSign UpBy signing up for this newsletter, you agree to NZME’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.But NZ Steel boss Robin Davies blithely told RNZ yesterday it would not have taken this step on its own because “there would be no direct financial benefit”.In the next breath, he had the nerve to add insult to injury by declaring that “everybody is committed to fighting climate change”.Of course NZ Steel should not have to be bribed. Luxon got that right. It’s outrageous that major emitters in this country, of which NZ Steel is one, expect to be paid before they will act responsibly.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.But that’s the reality and it gives every Government a choice. Carrot or stick? Either they incentivise companies to do the right thing, or they force them to do it with regulations. Or both.And that’s where Luxon has gone wrong. If he’s horrified at the idea of using a carrot, then he has to get out the big stick. But is he going to do that? Nope.“I’ve gone and met with the CEO and the management teams [of NZ Steel] and saw the site myself last year,” he said yesterday. “I really like the direction of where they’re going. But they are quite capable of … fronting up that $140 million themselves.”He trusts the company to do the right thing on its own, after they did a snow job on him last year. It’s absurdly naive and Davies has frankly admitted as much.Or perhaps Luxon is pinning his hopes elsewhere - on some marvellous invention that offers the benefits of carrots and sticks without the need for direct government intervention. It does exist. It’s called the market, otherwise known, in emissions economics, as the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).Just a reminder about that. The only way the ETS can drive our emissions even remotely close to zero on its own is by forcing up the cost of fossil fuels: Petrol, coal and gas. Making it too expensive for emitters to emit, so they find alternatives.As the cost of emissions rises, so will the cost of your petrol, food, clothes and all the other goods you buy. Also, the cost of construction – roads as well as buildings. The fertiliser that goes on farms, the gas in your home, every bit of plastic you touch, the list goes on.But for decades now, no Government here or anywhere in the world has been prepared to let that happen. The price of petrol is never allowed to climb anywhere near the cost of the damage it does.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The ETS has a role, but it will not lead us to a low-emissions future because it’s inconceivable that National or Labour or any other party would allow that to happen in practice.National Party leader Christopher Luxon trusts companies such as NZ Steel to do the right thing on their own. Photo / Jed BradleyDon’t get me wrong. Keeping the cost of living even roughly manageable is a social good and a necessary role of any Government. But if we agree on that, it becomes essential to use other levers to reduce emissions. Subsidies and penalties.The NZ Steel subsidy will mean power for making steel is produced by renewable electricity, not coal. In many ways, it’s a model for how we can move away from fossil fuels.One is scale. The deal is “the single largest decarbonisation project in the country’s history”, said Climate Change Minister James Shaw. It will be the equivalent, as Energy Minister Megan Woods said, of taking 300,000 cars off the road.A second advantage is that it’s not long since NZ Steel was in a standoff with the Government, threatening to abandon its operations here because of the ETS. This deal wipes out that rather nasty dispute. The company has been brought into the tent, where we need it to be.Which points to the third advantage: The role the company will now play in the economy. Instead of making steel from iron sands, the electric arc furnace will allow scrap steel to be melted and reused. Dead cars won’t be shipped overseas but will become the raw material for other products – perhaps, one day, including new electric cars.As Shaw said, this will help “build a more circular, resilient economy”. And create skilled jobs.And there’s a fourth benefit: This can happen quickly.All four of these things – reduced emissions, a circular economy, good jobs and speedy results – are climate filters through which all Government planning should pass.Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and Minister for Energy and Resources Megan Woods at the Glenbrook steel mill south of Auckland yesterday, Photo / Alex Burton This is real-world decision-making: The Government doing a deal that serves the country’s strategic interest, both short- and long-term, even if it has to hold its nose a little. You’d think a businessperson would understand that.I, for one, look forward to buying a bicycle made from the carcasses of old utes. The marketing potential is strong.But let’s not over-egg it. The deal will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 per cent. If it’s a model for progress, it also has to be used as a “just getting started” exercise.And while the Government will offer incentives to other companies, it can’t bribe them all. Luxon didn’t put it like this, but taxpayers cannot keep paying for corporate greed.So tougher emissions regulations are needed. Let’s force Fonterra to move far more quickly to lower both carbon and methane emissions: It’s hardly going to shut up shop and move offshore. Let’s have limits on the number and type of vehicles that can be imported. If the car companies threaten to disappear, we can laugh in their faces.Because this is where the national emissions strategy should be focused: When it comes to carbon, corporate emitters, not private citizens, do most of the damage. Meanwhile last week’s Budget produced a predictably disappointing response from another sector of the corporate world, the Employers and Manufacturers Association (EMA).When are they going to try sounding like they live in the 21st century?“Budget 2023 … really only leaves the crusts for business,” declared chief executive Brett O’Riley.“We didn’t expect much and we didn’t get much ... It’s appropriate that there is more support for core services and our communities, but business is what makes the economy go around.”Actually, Brett, people make the economy go around.Read MoreClimate change: NZ Steel to transition away from burning ...Why Government is making a big deal of the NZ Steel ...Simon Wilson: Tax avoidance is the ram-raiding of the ...Simon Wilson: Hey Grant Robertson, here’s some rabbits ...And while the Budget wasn’t great, it did contain several measures that, being good for people, will be good for business. Take the extension of subsidies for early childhood education.If you’re an EMA member, better access to childcare means your workers can return to work more easily, keep their skillsets up to date more easily and be happier in their own lives. Which will make them more productive for you.It’s a convenient fiction that childcare support is not a valuable business policy. If our so-called business leaders were not so overwhelmingly men of a certain age, they might grasp that.Employers and Manufacturers Association chief executive Brett O'Riley. Photo / Michael CraigChildcare support is also a social policy. We know the immense importance of the preschool years. We know children who have been in good childcare are less likely to start school behind their peers in educational and social development and more likely to keep those advantages alive.This means social values are also business values. Such kids are less likely to ram-raid your shop and more likely to become the productive, skilled, literate and numerate workers business groups keep telling us we need more of. This is what “wellbeing budget” means.It’s time business leaders became champions of childcare. Mealy-mouthed mumbling about what’s “appropriate”, buried in a chorus of complaints, isn’t good enough.And it’s time the National Party stepped off the sidelines of the climate debate.Luxon said yesterday he was “on the side of Kiwi battlers”. It’s an insidious form of climate denialism to suggest “Kiwi battlers” don’t need climate action and/or don’t need a Government prepared to force, cajole and when necessary bribe the big emitters into it.Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from PoliticsPolitics‘Red tape police’: Act hopes to ditch excess regulation03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsWill it be Paula Bennett v Wayne Brown for Auckland mayor in 2025?03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsClaire Trevett: Backtracks and attack tactics make for messy week in politics02 Jun 06:00 PMPoliticsAct to continue mission to double its vote in 2023 election at annual conference02 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Video / Ahiparadise Photography and Lennox Goodhue-Wikitera ...Waka Kotahi is being accused of being too risk-averse after closing the Auckland Harbour Bridge on five occasions on Saturday.The transport agency lowered its threshold for closing all lanes of the bridge after it was damaged by a truck crash in 2020, and Devonport-Takapuna local board member George Wood believes it is now over-reacting.Concerned about the “mayhem” caused by repeated closures, he wants Waka Kotahi to review its procedures for closing the bridge or look at alternative solutions.“It seems ever since that truck hit the bridge they’ve got the jitters and they’re so risk averse that I think their reasoning and the way they do it needs to be looked at,” he told the Herald.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.One of his suggestions was more precise, to-the-minute forecasting - but meteorologists said this had previously proven complex and costly.Wood, a former councillor, said the successive closures on Saturday, when wind gusts reached 91km/h, were frustrating.“It seems that it shuts and then a short time later it opens again. So have they got better systems they could put in place to actually monitor the gusts?”Former Auckland councillor George Wood wants Waka Kotahi's procedures for closing the bridge to be reviewed. Photo /  Dean PurcellWaka Kotahi maintainence and operations manager for Auckland and Northland Jacqui Hori-Hoult said the agency’s priority was public safety and the bridge structure, and it did not take the decision to close the bridge lightly.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.All lanes were closed when wind gusts exceeded 90km/h. The direction of the wind was also taken into account, and there were different limits for headwinds or crosswinds.Waka Kotahi noted the role of climate change and its effects on the transport network.“While the overall annual rainfall total has not increased by much, the intensity has, resulting in much higher numbers of short, sharp intense rainfall and high wind gusts affecting the Auckland Harbour Bridge,” Hort-Hoult said.Wood said he accepted that changing climate patterns played a role in more frequent closures of the bridge in the past few years but felt that there needed to be a pragmatic solution than constant closures.The truck crash in September 2020 was caused by a 127km/h gust of wind. It led to the closure of some of the bridge lanes for more than two weeks while repairs took place.Before the incident, all lanes of the bridge were closed if the perpendicular wind speed was averaging 100-110km/h and the oblique wind speed was exceeding 120km/h. Those thresholds were lowered to 90km/h and 105km/h respectively in October 2020.While Wood was seeking more sensitive modelling of high winds, previous experience has shown this can be difficult.National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) scientists were coincidentally testing a highly localised wind forecast for Emirates Team New Zealand in the Hauraki Gulf at the time of the truck crash.They found that while they could accurately predict the time and direction of the wind around the bridge, they underestimated the most extreme wind gusts.The bridge’s structure caused the wind to speed up at road level, with gusts and mean speeds 10 to 15 per cent higher on the road surface compared to the forecast peak gusts.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Meteorologist Dr Richard Turner, who worked on the modelling, said he sympathised with the transport officials who were responsible for making decisions about closing the bridge.“It is tricky. They have to think about safety first and foremost and I couldn’t imagine they would do it lightly.”Niwa’s modelling showed it was possible to do highly specific forecasting of a structure but also that it would be “hideously expensive” to run because of the computer power required, Dr Turner said.Another suggestion has been building wind breaks onto the harbour bridge - though that has not been seriously considered by Waka Kotahi and is believed to raise a number of engineering problems.Niwa noted overseas scientists have been investigating what models of vehicle are most likely to overturn in particular weather conditions, and this research could help inform procedures for the bridge in future.WHEN IS THE BRIDGE CLOSED?AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Before October 2020:Wind speed (perpendicular): 100-110km/h averageWind speed (oblique): 120km+After October 2020:Wind speed (perpendicular): 90km/hWind speed (oblique): 105km/hAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Photo / Michael Craig.Auckland has been drenched with nearly an entire year’s rainfall in fewer than five months, with totals running almost three times above average.The latest weather station data from Auckland Airport shows a whopping 1018.6mm of rain has fallen there since January 1, just over 90 per cent of the annual average.Had it been an average year for rain, the station would have recorded only about 381mm so far – which was still more than the 257mm and 250mm it logged at this time in 2022 and 2021 respectively.Much of the year’s extra rain has come in one-off extreme events, notably the one-in-200-year Auckland Anniversary Weekend deluge that contributed to the city’s wettest month in at least 170 years.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.A whopping 280mm fell on Albert Park on January 27 - 211mm of that coming in under six hours.“Certainly, 2023 is the wettest start to a year [in Auckland] by a considerable margin,” MetService meteorologist Andrew James said.The only years that happened to come close – but still by a long way - were 2011 (600mm at this time of year) and 2017 (634mm).

The start of the year had been especially gloomy for Aucklanders, who received a paltry five hours of daily sunshine over January, amid what one forecaster called a “bummer summer” of relentless rain and humidity.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.To date, however, Niwa’s station at Motat had recorded about 837 sunshine hours, which wasn’t far off the end-of-May cumulative average of 909 hours.Elsewhere in the north, rainfall figures were similarly staggering.Whangārei Airport received 1327.8mm this year, roughly three times its mean of 494mm for the year to date. Tauranga Airport’s station had recorded 1043.8mm, about twice its year-to-date mean of 527.6mm.Hamilton Airport had logged 665mm, versus a mean of 442mm.Big totals were also registered at New Plymouth Airport (665mm against a mean of 470mm) and Whanganui (558.2mm compared with a 341mm year-to-date mean).On Saturday, Whanganui recorded its second wettest May day in more than 40 years of records, with 52.4 mm.At the very top of the North Island, a Cape Reinga station had so far measured 739.4mm,  more than 250 per cent of its 285.5mm mean.Further south, however, the year had been a hot and dry one.Invercargill’s rainfall to mid-May only amounted to about 374mm, which was below average for the city.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.James singled out one culprit in particular for the north’s sopping-wet start to 2023: La Nina.The ocean-driven climate pattern – known for bringing muggy, wet conditions to the northeast but a drier flavour to the south – has meddled with our weather since the start of the decade.“[The rain has] been mostly driven off the back of La Nina, which has made it easier for these systems to come out of the north toward us,” James said.“We’ve had lots of very warm air coming over New Zealand as a result of La Nina, and warmer air can hold more moisture than cooler air, so we’ve seen significant rainfall right across the north, from Taranaki upward.”The stage had already been set by the negative phase of another climate phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole – a big cause of 2022′s record-wet and warm winter – and local pressure systems unfortunately positioned by a positive Southern Annular Mode.Rain-makers had also been intensified by regional marine heatwaves, the damp influence of the equator-circling Madden Julian Oscillation, and ongoing climate heating that’s loading more moisture into the atmosphere.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.While the La Nina system itself dissipated earlier in autumn, its effects were still lingering in an ocean-atmosphere lag that meteorologists have partly attributed to this month’s soakings.Coming in its place was its counterpart climate pattern El Nino, which spelt a potentially record-hot year for the planet, but a shift to cooler, drier conditions across much of New Zealand.

Earlier this month, scientists suggested the sun-blocking, ocean-cooling effects of Australia’s catastrophic bushfires in 2019-2020 might have triggered the three-year La Niña.Another new study found that strong La Nina and El Nino events have been becoming more frequent under climate change.While theories about last year’s Hunga-Tonga eruption causing the extra rain have been shared across social media, climate scientists have told the Herald that any direct rainfall effect – namely increased rainfall under its tropospheric water vapour plume – would have played out within weeks, early last year.Meanwhile, forecasters are picking a sunny reprieve for many regions in the north – but not before another low-pressure system makes its way across tonight and tomorrow.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Many parts of the North Island can expect rain or showers, very likely with accompanying thunderstorms, between today and tomorrow,” MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said.Severe weather watches for heavy rain are in place across the Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of Plenty and Tairāwhiti-Gisborne and the Wairoa District.Although rainfall amounts may not reach warning criteria over widespread areas, sodden grounds mean even lower accumulations could bring the risk of impacts such as surface flooding.While the eastern North Island has some showers into Wednesday, the rest of the island will feel the welcome influence of a high-pressure system.

“This high pressure brings a temporary clearance in weather that people in the North Island have been waiting for over a couple of weeks now,” Makgabutlane said.“It probably won’t last long enough to fully dry the washing, but it will be a welcome break from what has been a very wet month so far.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.That clearer weather continues for the rest of the working week; however, by Friday night, the upper North Island could have the odd shower again.Looking ahead, MetService meteorologists are keeping an eye on another low-pressure system over the north Tasman Sea that may drift southwards later this weekend.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Video / NZ HeraldNOW PLAYING • Focus: PM on major low emissions initiativeAnnouncement of major low emissions initiative with PM Chris Hipkins. Video / NZ HeraldAnalysisThe Government today announced a partnership with NZ Steel to spend up to $140 million on helping it transition away from burning coal in a move equivalent to taking 300,000 cars off
the road. It will be used to help the private company move from using coal to make new steel products out of iron-rich sands to melting scrap metal using electricity from the grid instead, and in doing so knock at least 1 per cent off the country’s total emissions.
How significant is this announcement?“There are not a lot of good climate change news stories - today is a good day,” quipped a visibly stoked Climate Change Minister James Shaw.Prime Minister Chris Hipkins called it the country’s “largest-ever emissions reduction project”.Make a beeline for the BeehiveGet weekly politics headlines with commentary from our political experts straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates. You can stop these at any time.Email addressSign UpBy signing up for this newsletter, you agree to NZME’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.So, how does it stack up?In terms of bang for a quick buck, this initiative is remarkable.NZ Steel accounts for 2 per cent of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, and halving the use of coal in its production will slash that by 45 per cent.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Sunday’s announcement, reducing carbon pollution by 800,000 tonnes, will knock off 1 per cent of New Zealand’s total annual emissions (provided it goes to plan and is up and running by 2027).Energy Minister Megan Woods said it was the equivalent of taking 300,000 cars off the road - or the entire Christchurch fleet.By contrast, the scrapped clear car upgrade “cash for clunkers” was to cost $569m and deliver just 2500 tonnes of emissions reductions over the first budget period (2022 to 2025).It reduces more emissions on its own than all the other 66 projects the Government has approved to date.It also involved a careful negotiation with Contact Energy which means renewable energy will be supplied in a way that does not impact peak electricity demand (and could have in turn seen coal burned to make up the difference).Climate Change expert Dr James Renwick told the Herald the steel deal was a “very significant” move given steel was one of the country’s single largest emitters, as well as in the context of meeting overall emissions reduction targets.New Zealand has committed to reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, as part of global efforts to keep global warming under 1.5C.The country has also committed internationally under the Paris Agreement to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by 50 per cent below gross emission levels in 2005, part of global efforts to limit warming to below 1.5C.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.To meet that target, New Zealand’s emissions between 2021 and 2030 must not exceed 571 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent gases (MtC02e).Today’s announcement was estimated to contribute 5.3 per cent of the emissions reductions needed under New Zealand’s second emissions budget (2026-2030), and 3.4 per cent within the third emissions budget (2031-2035).“The steel industry is described as a sector where it is hard to come up with renewable alternatives,” Renwick said.“So this is a great initiative and a real win in terms of emissions reduction and recycling; a move towards a circular economy.”Why is steel production such a big emitter?Coal is conventionally used given the high temperatures needed in chemical reactions to create iron, the main ingredient needed to make steel. About 70 per cent of the world’s steel is made using coal.Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, Minister for Energy and Resources Megan Woods and Climate Change Minister James Shaw at the Glenbrook steel mill south of Auckland. Photo / Alex BurtonThere is currently limited - and very expensive - technology available for alternatives, aside from melting and re-using scrap steel (which can be done with conventional electricity).NZ Steel produces about 670,000 tonnes of steel each year for mainly domestic consumption. Key products include roofing, structural beams, steel framing and reinforcing steel.NZ Steel CEO Robin Davies said in New Zealand, they intended to eventually cut the other 55 per cent of their emissions by progressively increasing the ratio of scrap metal used along with developing energy sources in hydrogen and natural gas to replace coal. Does this account for the climate change-focused policies the PM canned earlier this year?In short, no.Those climate policy U-turns and fossil fuel subsidies blew up roughly 16 per cent of the emissions reductions the Government had wanted to achieve by 2025 - and to which it is still committed.Most of that comes from the binning of the “sustainable biofuels obligation”, which came in Hipkins’ first round of reprioritisations in February, and the Clean Car Upgrade and the Social Leasing Scheme.At the time, Hipkins said there were more effective - and cheaper - ways of reducing emissions.Shaw told the Herald as the new furnace was not expected to be up and running until 2026/27, it would not help with the hole in the first budget to 2025.“We’re still in quite a tight spot,” he said. The Government was working through some options currently to plug that gap, he said.Is this just corporate welfare?National and Act were quick to oppose the initiative, with respective leaders Christopher Luxon and David Seymour calling it “corporate welfare” - a term they have both used to criticise many of the Government’s partnerships with industry to reduce emissions.Seymour and others have also argued such industry decisions should be influenced by a properly functioning Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Essentially, as the price of pollution increased, companies would be encouraged to cut emissions.The money comes out of the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) fund, which was set up in 2020 and received a $650m boost in last year’s Budget.The funding has been allocated from the Government’s Climate Emergency Response Fund, which itself is funded by proceeds from the ETS - essentially, the money has come from polluters themselves.However, ultimately, the Government does decide what to do with that money.Governments do invest and subsidise in various industries all the time - generally speaking, they are seeking a broader return, whether it be for the economy, retaining jobs and/or improving social and environmental outcomes.The recent Budget, for example, included $160m over four years to subsidise the gaming industry - something National said it supported.NZ Steel itself said without Government support, the project would not have happened.Shaw told the Herald Government support was also necessary to make it happen as quickly as possible, as it would be responsible for paying for any emissions targets the country didn’t meet in the long run (with some high-level estimates reaching $24 billion by 2030).“The lifetime abatement cost is forecast at $16.20 per tonne. Current carbon prices are around $55 per tonne. In the long term, this saves the Government and the country money.”The deal would also ensure over 1500 people kept their jobs, and help establish a wider scrap metal recycling industry - something that would be needed as 4.2m internal combustion engine vehicles eventually made way for electric alternatives.NZ Steel also currently receives a free allocation under the ETS as an “emissions-intensive, trade-exposed” business – recognising that ETS costs might impact the international competitiveness of these businesses. This means it would not be influenced in the same way as other industries.Shaw said this allocation would reduce in line with its reductions in carbon emissions.Renwick told the Herald what governments chose to invest in was a political decision.“You could see this as a case of the Government helping to move them in the right direction. It might have happened anyway, but maybe not as quickly.“More of this will have to happen. The Government is changing the way the economy operates. It will cost money, so it does need to think about that.”Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail105Comments AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from PoliticsPolitics‘Red tape police’: Act hopes to ditch excess regulation03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsWill it be Paula Bennett v Wayne Brown for Auckland mayor in 2025?03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsClaire Trevett: Backtracks and attack tactics make for messy week in politics02 Jun 06:00 PMPoliticsAct to continue mission to double its vote in 2023 election at annual conference02 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Zelenskyy’s in-person visit to the G7 summit comes just hours after the United States agreed to allow training on potent American-made fighter jets, laying the groundwork for their eventual transfer to Ukraine.Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (left), Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, France's President Emmanuel Macron, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, US President Joe Biden, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the G7 summit. Photo / APHost nation Japan said Zelenskyy’s inclusion stems from his “strong wish” to participate in talks with the bloc and other countries that will influence his nation’s defense against Russia.“Japan. G7. Important meetings with partners and friends of Ukraine. Security and enhanced cooperation for our victory. Peace will become closer today,” Zelenskyy tweeted upon his arrival on a plane provided by France.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME. An EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters on the deliberations, said Zelenskyy will take part in two separate sessions Sunday. The first session will be with G7 members only and will focus on the war in Ukraine. The second session will include the G7 as well as the other nations invited to take part in the summit, and will focus on “peace and stability”.US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said President Joe Biden and Zelenskyy would have direct engagement at the summit. Yesterday, Biden announced his support for training Ukrainian pilots on US-made F-16 fighter jets, a precursor to eventually providing those aircraft to Ukraine’s Air Force.Zelenskyy also met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, their first face-to-face talks since the war, and briefed him on Ukraine’s peace plan, which calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the country before any negotiations.Russia’s deputy defense minister, Alexander Grushko, accused Western countries of “continuing along the path of escalation,” following the announcements that raised the possibility of sending F-16s to Kyiv.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The G7 vowed to intensify the pressure in its joint statement today.“Russia’s brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace,” the group said.World leaders have faced a balancing act at the G7 in Hiroshima as they look to address a raft of global worries demanding urgent attention, including climate change, AI, poverty and economic instability, nuclear proliferation and, above all, the war in Ukraine.China, the world’s No 2 economy, sits at the nexus of many of those concerns.Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (left) and France's President Emmanuel Macron. Photo / APThere is increasing anxiety that Beijing, which has been steadily building up its nuclear weapons programme, could try to seize Taiwan by force, sparking a wider conflict. China claims the self-governing island as its own and regularly sends ships and warplanes near it.The G7 on Saturday said they did not want to harm China and were seeking “constructive and stable relations” with Beijing, “recognising the importance of engaging candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China.”They also urged China to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine and “support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.”North Korea, which has been testing missiles at a torrid pace in an attempt to perfect a nuclear programme meant to target the mainland United States, must completely abandon its nuclear bomb ambitions, the leaders’ statement said, “including any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology. North Korea cannot and will never have the status of a nuclear-weapon state under” international nuclear treaties.The green light on F-16 training is the latest shift by the Biden administration as it moves to arm Ukraine with more advanced and lethal weaponry, following earlier decisions to send rocket launcher systems and Abrams tanks. The United States has insisted that it is sending weapons to Ukraine to defend itself and has discouraged attacks by Ukraine into Russian territory.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (front left) sits opposite Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at their bilateral meeting. Photo / AP“We’ve reached a moment where it is time to look down the road again to say what is Ukraine going to need as part of a future force, to be able to deter and defend against Russian aggression as we go forward,” Sullivan said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The G7 leaders have rolled out a new wave of global sanctions on Moscow as well as plans to enhance the effectiveness of existing financial penalties meant to constrain President Vladimir Putin’s war effort. Russia is now the most-sanctioned country in the world, but there are questions about the effectiveness.“Our support for Ukraine will not waver,” the G7 leaders said in a statement released after closed-door meetings. They vowed “to stand together against Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”.“Russia started this war and can end this war,” they said.Zelenskyy has consistently called for Western fighter jets to bolster his country’s defences. As Ukraine has improved its air defences with a host of Western-supplied anti-aircraft systems and prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russia, officials believe the jets could become essential to the country’s long-term security.Biden’s decisions on when, how many, and who will provide the fourth-generation F-16 fighter jets will be made in the months ahead while the training is under way, Biden told leaders.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrives at Hiroshima Airport to attend the Group of Seven nations' meetings. Photo / APJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida separately held talks today with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, which is hosting the gathering of G20 world leaders later this year. During their meeting, Kishida emphasised that attempts to change by force shouldn’t be tolerated anywhere in the world — a possible reference to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a warning to China over Taiwan.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.India, the world’s largest democracy, has been measured in its comments on the war in Ukraine, and has avoided outright condemnation of Russia’s invasion. While India maintains close ties with the US and its Western allies, it is also a major buyer of Russian arms and oil.The latest sanctions aimed at Russia include tighter restrictions on already-sanctioned people and firms involved in the war effort. More than 125 individuals and organisations across 20 countries have been hit with US sanctions.In addition, new reporting requirements were issued for people and firms that have any interest in Russian Central Bank assets. The purpose is to “fully map holdings of Russia’s sovereign assets that will remain immobilised in G7 jurisdictions until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine”, the US Treasury Department said.The G7 nations said that they would work to keep Russia from using the international financial system to prosecute its war, and they urged other nations to stop providing Russia with support and weapons “or face severe costs”.Read MoreRussia-Ukraine war: Boris Johnson says Putin would ...G7 Summit: Donald Trump indicates he still believes ...G7 summit: Leaders demand new investigation into the ...The leaders began the summit with a visit to a peace park dedicated to the tens of thousands who died in the world’s first wartime atomic bomb detonation.

She’s desperate to stay18 May, 2023 09:36 PM10 minutes to readNew York TimesBy   Rachel ChaundlerSaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemailOn a stormy day in the spring of 2021, the sea defences on the beach below Lucy Ansbro’s cliff-top home in Thorpeness washed away. Then, the end of her garden collapsed into the North Sea.As she watched the plants tumble over the edge, she feared that her house in this coastal village 110 miles (177 kilometres) northeast of London would be next.“We lost three and a half metres of land,” said Ansbro, 54, a television producer, sitting in her kitchen on a recent morning. “Every time I went out, I didn’t know if the house would still be here when I came back.”Coastal erosion is a natural process as waves pound beaches around the globe, but along this stretch of England’s eastern coastline, stronger storms and bigger waves are striking fear in residents like never before.Thousands of homes here are threatened by the sea, and the government agencies tasked with defending them are straining to keep pace. The Committee on Climate Change, an independent body that advises Britain’s Environment Agency, has reported that 8900 residential properties — 1200 of which stand on stretches of coastline with no protective structures — are at risk from coastal erosion. Without active shoreline management, around 82,000 homes could be lost by 2105.Lucy Ansbro in the kitchen of her home, about 40 feet from the edge of a cliff overlooking the North Sea, in the village of Thorpeness, England, on May 18, 2023. Photo / Andy Haslam, The New York TimesTo stem the tide, the Environment Agency has pledged £5.2 billion (around NZ$10.3b) to build and realign 2000 defence structures — including sea walls made from rocks or cement and steel — that could protect communities from erosion and flooding, though not forever.But in some high-risk coastal communities, homes are being left to the mercy of nature. Distraught homeowners in these areas are facing the prospect of eviction and, worse, of demolishing their own homes.Keep up to date with the day's biggest storiesSign up to our daily curated newsletter for the day's top stories straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

After she lost her garden, she applied for permission from the local East Suffolk Council and Environment Agency authorities to replace the gabions (metal cages filled with rocks) and the sand-filled geobags that had been lost with riprap. The requests were granted, but that didn’t necessarily mean help was on the way.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.In England, the costs of building sea defences are shared by national and local offices. On the national level, a funding calculator assesses how much of that £5.2b budget is potentially available. It depends on whether the “benefits are greater than the costs”, based on a timeline of erosion and four location-specific policy tiers: Advance the Line, where new defences extend the land area out to sea; Hold the Line, where new defences maintain the existing shoreline; Managed Realignment, in which the shoreline is allowed to erode but money is spent “to direct it in certain areas”; and No Active Intervention, where no national funds are invested.Coastal erosion in the village of Skipsea, England, on May 18, 2023. Photo / Andy Haslam, The New York TimesOn a local level, councils and landowners are left to make up the difference.Related articlesNew Zealand'The beach is gone': Homeowner accused of building towering seawall and carting away sand07 Sep 07:31 AMPoliticsBudget 2023 breakdown: Massive EV charging expansion among climate change initiatives18 May 03:32 AMNew Zealand'Scandalous': Owners of flood-damaged home suffering after bank took payout17 May 06:00 PMNew ZealandManaged retreat, daylighting streams part of Brown's $1.4b flood recovery plan17 May 01:41 AM“In layperson’s terms, the policies are referred to as defend, retreat or abandon,” said Angela Terry, CEO of One Home, a group advocating on behalf of homeowners at risk.Aware that the policy for Thorpeness is Managed Realignment, and that the local council’s sea-defence coffers were empty, Ansbro didn’t expect any support for her house. “I knew that if I didn’t come up with the money myself, I would lose my home,” she said.So she refinanced her London apartment to pay for the construction of a 1500-ton granite riprap to fortify the cliff below her property. It cost her almost £450,000, but the house is still standing.Her next-door neighbours, she said, did not invest in protecting their property, and were forced to vacate the house and then demolish it. “It was a shock to see it go,” Ansbro said, looking at the spot where the house had stood since the 1920s. “The community feels the government should be stepping in and paying for coastal defences.”Ansbro refinanced her London apartment to pay for the construction of a 1500-ton granite riprap to fortify the cliff below her property. Photo / Andy Haslam, The New York TimesIt’s not always possible. In a statement to The New York Times, an Environment Agency spokesperson defended the tiered system of aid for the coastline, saying “Protection measures may not be technically possible or affordable, or may be environmentally damaging.”Where the coastline cannot be defended, the British government is trying to help communities move back from the sea. Last year, as part of a broader £200m flood and coast innovation programme, £36m was earmarked to help residents in the two coastal districts with the highest erosion rates in England — East Riding of Yorkshire and North Norfolk — cover demolition costs and relocate.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The five-year pilot programme, which is still in a “preparatory phase”, aims “to work with communities on the coast that cannot sustainably be defended from coastal erosion”. But not everyone there is grateful.In the East Riding of Yorkshire village of Skipsea, Peter Garforth has lived in a brick house overlooking the beach from Green Lane for 23 years. When he bought the place, he felt safe. Despite the lack of sea defences, there was a road separating the end of his garden from the cliff edge, which was 185 feet away. He was delighted by “the best view in Yorkshire”, he said, and he made improvements to the property, which was built in 1985.A sign near Green Lane in Skipsea warns people not to venture onto the cliffs. Photo / Andy Haslam, The New York TimesBut then the road and a chunk of his garden crumbled into the sea during a cliff fall in 2009. It fell to Jane Evison, an East Riding of Yorkshire councillor, to explain to Garforth the government’s No Active Intervention policy. “It was a hard message to deliver,” Evison said. “Most people genuinely thought they would have their homes for the rest of their lives.”The road was never repaired, and the cliff is now approaching the minimum permissible distance from occupied homes, which is 9.36 metres. Thanks to the new pilot programme in his area, Garforth, 78, qualifies for assistance that could help him finally move inland. But he wants full funding for improved sea defences to protect his community.“We feel we are second-class citizens, not as deserving as others,” Garforth said. “Somehow the appetite to protect the coastline has been lost.”Read MoreClimate Change: Insurer eyes risk-pricing for coastal ...Port Waikato residents race against the clock as erosion ...More Westshore erosion as Napier coast takes a hammering ...Reluctant landowners bring Haumoana seawall plan to ...Most of the remaining properties on Green Lane are now abandoned and vandalised. Some were sold for nearly nothing in cash deals since banks won’t give mortgages for at-risk properties. Nor do insurance companies offer cover.Still, the East Riding of Yorkshire Council is keeping a close eye on the homes lining the beach. Every six months, aerial surveillance teams measure the distance between the porches at the front of the Green Lane properties and the cliff edge.“We don’t want a property going over the edge with anyone in it or anyone on the beach at the time,” said Richard Jackson, the council’s coastal change manager.The remains of Green Lane in Skipsea. The road once separated houses from the beach, but it is collapsing over time. Photo / Andy Haslam, The New York TimesGarforth is angry that the nearby hamlet of Mappleton is protected — by two sea walls and a revetment — while his village is not. But there is a reason: Route B1242, the main coastal road in the area, runs directly through Mappleton, warranting the hamlet’s Hold the Line status.There are other reasons for not erecting defences along much of the coastline. Some are environmental. “The erosion sediment in East Riding is important for Lincolnshire flood risk defences,” Jackson said, referring to the county just south. And of course, “Coastal defences are expensive,” he said, noting that building a riprap can cost £10,000 per meter.Garforth expects to have to vacate his home soon, and when that time comes, he aims to fight it. “When an eviction notice is slapped on my door, I’m taking it to the courts,” he said.Two hundred miles south in Hemsby, the shoreline has been allowed to erode in keeping with the Managed Realignment policy. In March, five homes were demolished after storms battered the cliffs.Noel Galer, a Great Yarmouth Borough councillor for Hemsby, said permission was recently granted for a 0.8-mile rock wall. But paying for it won’t be easy. The national funding calculator uses a formula based on the value of the homes at risk from erosion over the next 25 years. “With the value of these homes being low, the Environment Agency may provide £2 million,” he said.The council will have to come up with the rest. “We are now in the fundraising stage,” Galer said.Sea defences erected in the village of Mappleton. Photo / Andy Haslam, The New York TimesCoastal erosion has claimed English communities like Hemsby for centuries. A seat was even removed from Parliament in the 19th century after half the borough of Dunwich was lost to the North Sea. The eastern cliffs are composed of soft clay and gravel, and “if the clay gets wet, that makes it softer, so it erodes”, said Stuart McLelland, co-director of the Energy and Environment Institute at the University of Hull.Climate change is magnifying the risks for homeowners, as “rising sea levels make beaches smaller and an increase in storminess causes bigger waves”, McLelland said.Many coastal residents are selling their homes while they can. A recent search on Britain’s largest property portal, Zoopla, found 81 properties for sale in Hemsby village. Prices range from £26,000 for a two-bedroom bungalow to £600,000 for a five-bedroom villa.The properties are mostly “cash buys only”, said Bradley Stark, a senior property consultant at Minors & Brady Estate Agents, which is listing two at-risk properties in Hemsby.“We try not to put clients off, but we do have to give honest feedback about the area,” said Stark, whose firm sold a two-bedroom home, a mile down the coast from Hemsby, for £300,000 in cash last month.Evison, the East Riding councillor, warned that people there who bought coastal properties after 2009 will not be eligible for assistance under the new pilot programme. Still, for some house hunters, a property atop an unstable cliff can seem an attractive option — at the right price.Helen Vine with her partner, Pete Megson, behind the bar at the Sellwood Arms in Aldbrough. Photo / Andy Haslam, The New York TimesLast October, Helen Vine jumped at the chance to buy the Sellwood Arms pub, which sits near the cliffs in the village of Aldbrough, 12 miles south of Garforth’s home and subject to the same No Active Intervention policy. The pub is only about 215 feet from where the main road collapsed into the sea six years ago. With beamed ceilings and a four-bedroom apartment on the first floor, where Vine, 51, now lives with her family, the pub was a bargain at just over £100,000. Sepia photos of village landmarks lost to the sea over the decades hang on the walls. But she remains undaunted.“There’s no way I would have been able to afford a place like this anywhere else,” she said.Vine is renovating the rooms upstairs, without, she joked, going overboard on expenses. The plan is to recoup her investment, and maybe some more, before she is forced to demolish — hopefully not in the next couple of decades.“It’s a risk,” she said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Written by: Rachel ChaundlerPhotographs by: Andy Haslam©2023 THE NEW YORK TIMESUnlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemailAbout NZMEHelp & SupportContact UsSubscribe to NZ HeraldHouse RulesManage Your Print SubscriptionNZ Herald E-EditionAdvertise with NZMEBook Your AdPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseCompetition Terms & ConditionsSubscriptions Terms & Conditions© Copyright 2023 NZME Publishing LimitedAccess New Zealand's best journalismFrom $1.50 per weekSubscribe nowWeeklyFor the first 8 weeks, pay just$1.50per weekSubscribe nowRenews $6 per weekbest valueAnnualSave over $123   (compared to Weekly)$129for 1 yearSubscribe nowRenews $199 per weekLearn moreTOP search by queryly   Advanced Search

Video / NZ Herald The Government has announced major support in Budget 2023 for young public transport users, electric vehicle infrastructure, and New Zealand’s battered state highway and railway networks.Free public transport for children under 13 and half-price discounts for people under 25 are in the Budget, but for other commuters, half-price public transport is due to come to an end on June 30.Transport Minister Michael Wood said making public transport free for children will make it easier for them to get to school and could save $30 a week for a household of two children.Half-price fares for under 25s, as well as Community Service card holders and Total Mobility users, will benefit 1.6 million people and make it easier for people to get to go where they need to go, he said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.These measures will cost $327 million.Free and half-price public transport is part of the Budget. Photo / FileMika Hervel, a spokesman for the Free Fares campaign, said the measures to extend cheaper public transport are a step in the right direction.“It is awesome to see the Government invest in young people and recognise the climate crisis.“Keeping half-price fares for under 25s is a great way to lock in benefits from the [half-price fare] scheme and help address the cost of living for many people,” said Hervel, saying the group would continue to encourage the Government to go further.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.As well as extending half-price public transport for those under 25, the Budget enables public transport agencies, like Auckland Transport, to raise the base rate for bus drivers from $28 an hour to $30 in most regions across the country.It also provides for the introduction of $30 for each split shift and penal rates for bus drivers working after 9pm. Long days and low pay have been a big factor in a prolonged shortage of bus drivers in Auckland and Wellington, forcing passengers to crowd on to fewer services.In another transport announcement, Wood said the Government is spending $120m over four years to partner with the private sector to build thousands of new EV chargers across the country.Boosting the number of EVs on main highways and in communities is included in the Budget. Photo / Alan Gibson“This will see charging hubs every 150km to 200km on main highways, a public charger for every 20 to 40 EVs in urban areas, and public charging at community facilities for all settlements with 2000 or more people.”A further $30m has been set aside to provide grants for low-emission heavy vehicles, including trucks, heavy vans, and non-public transport buses. Another $279m has been set aside in the Budget to make state highways more resilient against severe weather events, like Auckland’s Anniversary Weekend floods and Cyclone Gabrielle.Wood said the money would focus on slip prevention, flood mitigation, and managing the risk of sea level rise.Projects include slope stabilisation at various SH1 locations, including Long Hill, Saunders Rd, and Kaiwaka in Northland, upgrades to pumping stations at Mt Wellington and Pukekohe in Auckland, and managing the risk of coastal inundation on SH26 at the top of the South Island.The Budget has set aside $279m to make state highways more resilient. Photo / FileWaka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency chief executive Nicole Rosie told an infrastructure conference this week the transport agency had costed resilience plans for the state highways four years ago at about $500m and only spent $14m “because that’s all that’s been allocated to resilience”.She said the state highway system was eroding and at a tipping point.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.KiwiRail will receive an extra $370m to repair its railways and consider how it could expand the national rail network, which could include building a new freight/passenger railway line between Avondale and Southdown on designated land set aside in the 1940s.As part of the “Future of Rail” programme, KiwiRail has been asked to prepare “a detailed business case for electrification of the North Island Main Trunk line”.The bulk of this funding, $383 million worth, would arrive in 2025.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Photo / GettyNew York City is sinking, and its many towering skyscrapers could be part of the problem. Photo / GettyThe weight of New York City’s towering, tourist-attracting skyscrapers could be causing the city to sink, according to a new study from the academic journal Earth’s Future. Satellite data has shown that the city is subsiding at a gradual rate of one to two millimetres a year.Tom Parsons, a geologist from the US Geological Survey agency, and researchers from the University of Rhode Island have been considering the role that the weight of New York City’s built environment might play in a process called ‘subsidence’. This term is used to refer to either natural or man-made changes in “downward elevation”.The study suggests that parts of Manhattan Island could be sinking as quickly as Venice. The Italian tourist spot has sunk 15 centimetres in the last 100 years, according to the Castello Institute of Marine Sciences, and the acqua alta [spring tide floods] are not an uncommon occurrence. But could Times Square eventually resemble St Mark’s?The process has a range of causes, including the interaction between water and soils, tectonic activity, mining and other human interventions.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The idea that coastal cities could be especially prone to subsidence, increasing the threat from projected sea level rises, has been well established. However, the researchers in this study look to the impacts and weight of the built urban environment, a cause not often considered as a contribution to subsidence.Tourists walk above high water in Venice's Piazza San Marco - or St Mark's Square - during the high tide of an acqua alta. Photo / Stefano Mazzola, Getty ImagesThe Empire State Building, once the city’s largest skyscraper, proudly proclaims its weight as 331,000 tonnes, with its structure using more than 1 million cubic metres of Indiana limestone. It’s not just Manhattan that is sinking under the weight of its skyline.Within the study, the researchers calculate the mass of over a million buildings located within the five boroughs of New York City and model their potential contribution to subsidence across a variety of soil types.

Photo / APThere’s a two-out-of-three chance that the world will temporarily hit a key warming limit within the next five years, the United Nations weather agency says.But it likely would only be a fleeting and less worrisome flirtation with the internationally agreed-upon temperature threshold. Scientists expect a temporary burst of heat from El Niño - a naturally-occurring weather phenomenon - to supercharge human-caused warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas to new heights. Temperatures are expected to then slip back down a bit.The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) forecasts a 66 per cent likelihood that between now and 2027, the globe will have a year that averages 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the mid-19th century.That number is critical because the 2015 Paris climate agreement set 1.5C as a global guardrail in atmospheric warming, with countries pledging to try to prevent that much long-term warming if possible.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Scientists in a special 2018 United Nations report said going past that point would be drastically and dangerously different with more death, destruction and damage to global ecosystems.“It won’t be this year probably. Maybe it’ll be next year or the year after” that a year averages 1.5C warmer, said report lead author Leon Hermanson, a climate scientist at the United Kingdom’s Met Office.But climate scientists said what’s likely to happen in the next five years isn’t the same as failing the global goal.Extinction Rebellion activists and sympathisers shouted slogans against global warming when blocking a busy road in The Hague, Netherlands. Photo / AP“This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years. However, the WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“We haven’t been able to limit the warming so far and we are still moving in the wrong, wrong direction,” Taalas said at a Wednesday press conference.Hermanson cautioned that “a single year doesn’t really mean anything”. Scientists usually use 30-year averages.Read MoreThe Front Page: Adaptation vs mitigation – What should ...Climate change: NZ could face $24 billion bill to hit ...Cyclone Gabrielle: How did climate change worsen our ...How to protect your next holiday from climate change ...Those 66 per cent odds of a single year hitting that threshold in five years have increased from 48 per cent last year, 40 per cent the year before, 20 per cent in 2020 and 10 per cent about a decade ago. The WMO report is based on calculations by 11 different climate science centres across the globe.The world has been inching closer to the 1.5-degree threshold due to human-caused climate change for years. The temporary warming of this year’s expected El Niño - which starts with a warming of parts of the central Pacific Ocean and then sloshes across the globe - makes it “possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5C a full decade before the long-term average,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth, which wasn’t part of the WMO report.“We don’t expect the longer-term average to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030s,” Hausfather said in an email.But each year at or near 1.5C matters.“We see this report as more of a barometer of how we’re getting close, because the closer you get to the threshold, the more noise bumping up and down is going to bump you over the threshold randomly,” Hermanson said in an interview. And he said the more random bumps over the mark occur, the closer the world actually gets to the threshold.Key in all this is the El Niño cycle. The world is coming off a record-tying triple dip La Niña - three straight years of El Niño’s cooler cousin restraining the human-caused warming climb - and is on the verge of an El Niño that some scientists predict will be strong.The La Nina somewhat flattened the trend of human-caused warming so that the world hasn’t broken the annual temperature mark since 2016, during the last El Niño, a super-sized one, Hermanson said.And that means a 98 per cent chance of breaking the 2016 annual global temperature record between now and 2027, the report said. There’s also a 98 per cent chance that the next five years will be the hottest five years on record, the report said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Because of the shift from La Niña to El Niño, “where there were floods before, there will be droughts, and where there were droughts before, there might be floods”, Hermanson said.The report warned that the Amazon will be abnormally dry for a good part of the next five years while the Sahel part of Africa - the transition zone between the Sahara on the north and the savannas to the south - will be wetter.That’s “one of the positive things coming out of this forecast”, Hermanson said. “It’s not all doom and gloom and heat waves.”University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann said reports like this put too much emphasis on global surface temperature, which varies with the El Niño cycle, even though it is climbing upward in the long term.The real concern is the deep water of oceans, which absorb an overwhelming majority of the world’s human-caused warming, leading to a steady rise in ocean heat content and new records set regularly.“I think it’s important to realise that if we pass 1.5 degrees, it’s not a reason to give up,” Hermanson said at a Wednesday news conference. “We have to continue working out how much we can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible, even after that, because it will make a difference.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from WorldPremiumWorldA British reporter had a big #MeToo scoop.

Video / NZ Herald The Government is putting nearly half a billion dollars behind grand plans to make Wellington a “science city”, with three new research hubs to be set up in the capital.Last year, the Government pitched plans to make the capital a “vibrant, resilient and adaptable centre of research, science and innovation” before 2030 as part of a wider, long-overdue makeover of our small but fragmented sector.This afternoon, Research, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall revealed more detail on the plans for Wellington, with $450m ear-marked in today’s Budget to support a trio of new hubs.Researchers from Niwa, GNS Science and Victoria and Massey Universities would work together as part of a national centre for studies on oceans, climate and hazards.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Read MoreBudget 2023 breakdown: Free medical prescriptions, ...Budget 2023 highlights: Key points of Grant Robertson's ...Budget 2023: Audrey Young - A practical budget for ...Budget 2023: Government's big borrow and spend plans ...Budget 2023: What's in it for you - Early childhood ...Another hub, focused on health and pandemic readiness, would bring together researchers from Victoria and Otago Universities, as well as the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), Callaghan Innovation and the Malaghan Institute.The third, involving experts from Victoria University along with GNS, Callaghan and Malaghan, would be based at a new research, technology and innovation park in Gracefield and focus on advanced manufacturing and materials, energy futures and biotech.“Through all of this, we will link talented university students to industry and Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) and increase opportunities for industry training and applied PhDs for exciting careers in science and research,” Verrall said.Verrall said that while the hubs would be based in the Wellington region, they’d benefit New Zealand as a whole.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Thin on funding, but some good initiatives in the science and innovation space in the Budget - three hubs for scientific collaboration and early career researchers get a look in. https://t.co/wz0due00rU— Peter Griffin (@petergnz) May 18, 2023

“These hubs will place greater emphasis on innovation and create an environment that helps start-ups to grow and become significant contributors to the New Zealand economy through stronger co-ordination of innovation and commercialisation activities.“This will include a significant investment in physical space and facilities to help entrepreneurs bring innovative new products to market.”The next step was to finalise the programme business case so that construction could begin.Elsewhere in the Budget was $55.2m targeted at research fellowships and training more PhD students.Related articlesBusinessBudget 2023: Video game industry gets its tax rebate, but it’s half the Aussie scheme; full tech wrap18 May 06:30 AM“The fellowships will help retain and develop more than 260 future leaders of research, science and innovation in New Zealand over the next 10 years,” Verrall said.“These expanded fellowships will also include dedicated awards for Māori and Pacific peoples to increase representation at all levels.”It's budget time for scientists as well as everybody else. Some first thoughts... (1/4)1) The big chunk of change here is $400 million for new buildings to co-locate researchers. But what about the researchers themselves? On that note, not much to be excited about. (2/4)— NZAS (@nzscientists) May 18, 2023

Another $37.6m was being directed at New Zealand’s involvement in the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme – making the country one of the first outside Europe to offer researchers to the seven-year, multi-billion-dollar effort.“This is new funding for New Zealand science and underlines our commitment to building a modern, future-focused research, science and innovation system.”In December, the Government outlined a fresh set of national “research priorities” for the country, in a blueprint representing the largest rethink of New Zealand’s science system in 30 years.Te Ara Paerangi has been largely welcomed by leading players, with cautious optimism the three-year makeover will tackle long-standing diversity gaps across our universities and institutes - particularly among under-represented Māori and Pasifika researchers.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Professor Nicola Gaston, co-director of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, said the new Wellington hubs and the Horizon funding aligned well with the stated aims of Te Ara Paerangi, to increase collaboration and break down silos among research institutes and universities.“I have been justifying the lack of new funding for science and research in recent successive budgets, on the basis of the sector reform process, Te Ara Paerangi, being a work in progress,” she said.“This year, with redundancies continuing to wreak havoc across our university sector in particular, the priority has had to be getting new funding into the system – the opportunity cost of not doing so has simply gotten too large.”She felt a “fundamental mistake” that’d been made over decades of research funding had been to “put the cart before the horse” by trying to fund outcomes rather than researchers.“So many of the issues that we recognise in our research system – the lack of connectivity, barriers to collaboration, a lack of diversification – are simple consequences of the fact that it is too small,” she said.“We have a very sparse network of researchers trying to cover a wide range of areas of expertise, which of course makes collaboration and connectivity hard.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Professor Travis Glare, of Lincoln University’s Research Management Office, welcomed the Budget’s Tertiary subsidies and increases for te reo Māori and mātauranga Māori provision, in a sector that was struggling to provide quality education in the face of increasing costs.“Support for increased enrolments in tertiary education also is a positive. These increases are not enough to keep up with the increasing costs, but at least help,” he said.“There are also specific increases in funding for PhD and research fellowships, which will improve the pathway for emerging researchers.“Again this is welcome, but there needs to be a similar increase in research funding to allow these newly trained researchers to continue with their careers.”SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Video / Mark Mitchell / Adam Pearse  ... The Government is hours away from unveiling Budget 2023, which will show how Finance Minister Grant Robertson will address the high cost of living and pay for the hefty bill left behind by Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland floods.Robertson has promised a “no frills” Budget that reflects the economic struggles the country is experiencing and the need to support communities ravaged by severe weather events.The Government has released a few teasers of what will be in Budget 2023. They include:$941 million in cyclone and flooding-related fundingPrime Minister Chris Hipkins, Robertson and an array of other ministers and MPs announced the almost $1 billion cyclone and flooding package in Hawke’s Bay on Sunday, devoting much of it ($475 million) to rebuild road and rail links.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Roughly $100m has been set aside to raise stopbanks and shore up lifelines that failed during record rainfalls, while other funding would be used to rebuild damaged schools, support the safety and wellbeing of farmers and growers and further resourcing for mental health support providers.Finance Minister Grant Robertson with Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and other ministers and MPs in Hawke's Bay. Photo / Warren BucklandRegarding the roading and rail investment, Transport Minister Michael Wood said damage to the North Island transport network by Cyclone Gabrielle and the January floods was putting financial pressure on councils.“We’re stepping in to cover more of the costs of clearance and rebuild so councils can get on with the work without having to rely on increasing rates.The funding included $275m earmarked for Waka Kotahi NZTA and local councils to repair affected roads. That was on top of $250m the Government announced immediately after Cyclone Gabrielle.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Through this funding Waka Kotahi will be able to consider requests from affected regions for higher levels of direct financial support to rebuild local roads,” Wood said.About $200m would be used to repair several sections of rail network, including the North Auckland Line and the Palmerston North to Gisborne Line, as well as the Auckland metropolitan network, the North Island Main Trunk and the East Coast Main Trunk.About $116m would fund immediate repairs to more than 500 damaged schools, with additional funding available for possible redevelopment or relocation of schools.A further $700,000 would be invested over two years for Special Reasons Staffing funding, $315,000 of that would be available immediately.Read MoreGovernment to splash $941m in Budget to rebuild communities ...Cyclone Gabrielle: Wairoa faces the ultimate test in ...Cyclone Gabrielle: A cyclone victim’s Budget 2023 wishlist ...Cyclone Gabrielle three months on: Flooding flashbacks, ...Just over $35m would be directed toward farmers and growers by supporting access to expert advice to address urgent health and safety, animal welfare needs, and to ensure the safety of ongoing operations.Of that, $5.4m would assist the operation of rural community hubs to ensure reliable communication.A further $10m would be devoted to community-led mental health support, including extending the successful Mana Ake programme developed after the Christchurch quakes into every school in the Hawke’s Bay and Tairāwhiti.300 more classrooms, up to four new schoolsOn Monday, Hipkin announced the construction of 300 new classrooms and up to four new schools through $300 million from this year’s Budget with “$200 million for permanent roll growth, and $100 million to address shorter-term pressures on school rolls”.“An additional $100 million will be added to the education infrastructure funding pipeline, which will enable the construction of up to four new schools and new school expansions, the first two projects are in central Auckland and Papamoa, with the remaining two projects to be announced in due course,” he said.The new rooms and four schools will create space for 6600 more students.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and Education Minister Jan Tinetti during a media standup after their pre-Budget 2023 education announcement at Rydgway School on Monday. Photo / Mark MitchellFurther announcements would be made on Budget Day in relation to investment in education infrastructure to support the Kaupapa Māori and Māori medium education sectors, as part of a wider Māori Education Package in Budget 2023.Family and sexual violence reduction gets $73.5mBudget 2023 will empower several providers aiming to reduce family and sexual violence through $73.5m of funding over four years.It included the extension of the Family Violence Help Portal, which would provide access to online tools and services available nationwide 24/7 for people experiencing, using, or supporting those impacted by family violenceYoung people would receive further resources through establishing advocates in eight Women’s Refuges, better supporting young people in the court system and expanding family dispute resolution practices to minimise harm to children.Access to specialist support through Waitematā Safeguarding response would be increased as well as expanding the initiative to two other locations, while also supporting improved access to mainstream family violence and sexual violence services for disabled peopleKaupapa Māori specialist sexual violence services for whānau would also be further resourced.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Tamariki forced to leave home and seek refuge in safe accommodation, most often with their mothers, will be better supported to stay safe, build resilience, and start to heal,” Social Development and Employment Associate Minister Priyanca Radhakrishnan said.Pay boost for Defence ForceNew Zealand Defence Force pay rates will be increased by between $4000 to $15,000, at a cost of $419 million over four years, committed in Budget 2023.A further $328m would also be spent on upgrading NZDF assets and infrastructure.The new pay rates, set to take effect from July 1, came amid concerns over the attrition rates within the Defence Force that would have compromised New Zealand’s response to an overseas incident had one occurred during Cyclone Gabrielle, Defence Minister Andrew Little said.Defence Minister Andrew Little. Photo / Marty MelvilleEmission reduction initiatives investor resourcedA total of $300m would be given to New Zealand Green Investment Finance Ltd, taking its pool of capital to $700m and making NZGIF one of the largest direct investors in New Zealand focused on climate change.Over the past four years, NZGIF had invested in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, solar power in schools, and electric buses.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“This capital investment will support existing and future projects, including transport, process heat, infrastructure and early-stage companies,” Climate Change Minister James Shaw said.“It will also open up new parts of the market and enable NZGIF to attract larger sums of private capital.”As at June 2022, the total estimated lifetime emissions reductions of its investments was 580,000 to 710,000 tonnes of CO2e. That was equivalent to 480,000 to 590,000 homes’ energy use for one year.Boost to Clean Car Discount Crown grantAbout $100m from Budget 2023 was committed to the Crown’s repayable grant for the Clean Car Discount.The scheme had exceeded industry and Government projections, with 20 per cent of all new passenger car sales being electric in 2022, a substantial increase from 8 per cent in 2021.SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from PoliticsPolitics‘Red tape police’: Act hopes to ditch excess regulation03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsWill it be Paula Bennett v Wayne Brown for Auckland mayor in 2025?03 Jun 06:00 PMPremiumPoliticsClaire Trevett: Backtracks and attack tactics make for messy week in politics02 Jun 06:00 PMPoliticsAct to continue mission to double its vote in 2023 election at annual conference02 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Photo / Warren BucklandEDITORIALThree days ago, Cyclone Mocha made landfall, causing widespread destruction along the coasts of Myanmar and Bangladesh, endangering millions, and displacing an estimated 400,000 people.
The powerful cyclone inundated the Myanmar port city of
Sittwe but largely spared a densely-populated cluster of refugee camps in low-lying neighbouring Bangladesh. The outcome could be described as miraculous, given the UN described the category-five cyclone as one of the strongest storms to hit Myanmar this century.
The “miracle” was the meteorological phenomenon of wind shear rising to prevent the storm from strengthening shortly after it made landfall. Mocha then weakened into a depression as it tracked east-northeastward towards Bangladesh.Still, at least six people have been reported dead in Myanmar, and up to 90 per cent of the western Rakhine state’s capital city Sittwe has been destroyed, residents told the BBC. The Burmese military declared the whole of Rakhine a natural disaster area.Start your day in the knowGet the latest headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

Photo / World Food Programme via APWe know this experience too, as we are still picking up the debris and counting the costs from cyclones Hale and Gabrielle. Only this week, State Highway 2 from Napier to Wairoa was reconnected, albeit with a dozen lights and stop-go controls along the essential link with the East Coast.And we know there will be continued events. New Zealand’s cyclone season lasts from November 1 until April 30, six months of the year. Hopefully, this means we have endured the worst of this season. The heavy rains associated with La Niña are predicted to flip to drier conditions of El Niño in our spring and summer.During this respite, however long it may last, we need to be laying down plans and making preparations for the next cyclone season. Tomorrow, Finance Minister Grant Robertson will deliver his sixth Budget, one he says he has themed on recovery and resilience.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“The severe weather events are a significant part of the backdrop to Budget 2023,” he told a BNZ breakfast last Friday. “Along with a deteriorating global economy and high inflation driving cost of living pressures for so many New Zealanders, they have made for a set of difficult decisions and trade-offs.”Among the rhetorical questions Robertson has reportedly asked himself in preparing the Budget was: “How do we handle what the world and the weather and the ground beneath us throws at us with increasing frequency and intensity?” Related articlesNew ZealandCan Budget 2023 break political stalemate?15 May 06:00 PMNew ZealandEditorial: Trump remains a frontrunner in next US presidential election14 May 06:00 PMNew ZealandEditorial: Floating in a sphere of political negativity13 May 06:00 PMNew ZealandEditorial: Urgent action needed on inundation12 May 06:00 PMHe has indicated close to a billion dollars will be spent helping cyclone-ravaged and flood-hit communities in the North Island, and futureproofing against new disasters.Read MoreCyclone Gabrielle: Forestry put ‘bread and butter’ ...Government to splash $941m in Budget to rebuild communities ...Cyclone Mocha: Myanmar homes flooded, communications ...National’s Christopher Luxon claims lack of action ...
Inevitably, much of the commentary from the Budget will focus on the winners and the losers, sectors that have gained or missed out on funding. Many such concerns will be entirely justified. But it would be prudent to bear in mind the big picture, our dynamic and threatening world.New Zealanders have suffered debilitating blows from recent weather events and are warned these will become less isolated; more common.As we reel under these blows, the global perspective tells us that we are not the hardest hit. But nor will it be long before we are challenged again.Unlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Photo / APRescuers early  today evacuated about 1000 people trapped by seawater 3.6m deep along western Myanmar’s coast after a powerful cyclone injured hundreds and cut off communications in one of Asia’s least-developed countries. The extent of the damage and the death toll are not yet known.Strong winds injured more than 700 of about 20,000 people who were sheltering in sturdier buildings on the highlands of Sittwe township such as monasteries, pagodas and schools, according to a leader of the Rakhine Youths Philanthropic Association in Sittwe. He asked not to be named because of fear of reprisals from the authorities in the military-run country.Seawater raced into more than 10 low-lying wards near the shore as Cyclone Mocha made landfall in Rakhine state on Sunday afternoon, he said. Residents moved to roofs and higher floors, while the wind and storm surge prevented immediate rescue.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“After 4 pm yesterday, the storm weakened a bit, but the water did not fall back. Most of them sat on the roof and at the high places of their houses the whole night. The wind blew all night,” the rescue group leader said.Water was still about 1.5m high in flooded areas Monday morning, but rescues were being made as the wind calmed and the sun rose in the sky. He asked civil society organisations and authorities to send aid and help evacuate residents.At least three deaths had been reported earlier in Myanmar, and several injuries were reported in neighbouring Bangladesh, which was spared the predicted direct hit.Women and children at a makeshift shelter set up for residents of coastal areas.

By Monday morning, it was downgraded from its severe status and was steadily weakening over land, according to the India Meteorological Department.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.High winds crumpled cell phone towers during the day, cutting off communications. In videos collected by local media before communications were lost, deep water raced through streets and wind blew off roofs.Myanmar’s military information office said the storm had damaged houses, electrical transformers, cell phone towers, boats and lampposts in Sittwe, Kyaukpyu, and Gwa townships. It said roofs were torn off buildings on the Coco Islands, about 425km southwest of the country’s largest city, Yangon.Local people walk on a flooded street caused by heavy rain as Cyclone Mocha approaches.

Authorities had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people before the cyclone veered east.About a dozen people were injured on Saint Martin’s Island, while some 300 homes were either destroyed or damaged, leading Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo reported.Buildings damaged by Cyclone Mocha.

Video / NZ HeraldA first-of-its-kind study assessing the rising economic fall-out of extreme weather disasters in New Zealand has flagged an urgent need for smarter, “needs-based” recovery packages for businesses, rather than blanket ones.With the country just having observed its wettest, warmest year and a summer of extreme storms, how to bear the massive costs of climate change’s physical impacts has come under sharper focus.Over recent weeks, New Zealand’s largest insurer reported a 402 per cent jump in weather-related claims, while a bleak Treasury report warned the direct impacts on businesses and communities would only grow.Yesterday, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins announced that $1 billion earmarked in this year’s Budget would help Hawke’s Bay, Tairāwhiti and Auckland recover from Cyclone Gabrielle, which, combined with the summer floods, are estimated to have cost between $9b to $14.5b.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The new study, led by Victoria University researcher Apurba Roy and published in the journal Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, reached back further, to the last decade.“We were interested to see if we could uncover any evidence on the impact of extreme weather events on businesses in New Zealand - no one had looked at that before,” said study co-author Professor Ilan Noy, chair of the university’s Economics of Disasters and Climate Change group.To analyse local economic trends in regions hit by past cyclones, floods and wildfires, the researchers compared information from a Stats NZ-run business database with Toka Tū Ake EQC (the Earthquake Commission) and Niwa (the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research) catalogues.In earlier work, the researchers had found such trends varied. For instance, while the individual incomes of people living in areas affected by big cyclones took a hit, the same pattern didn’t hold when they instead looked at peoples’ losses from experiencing more local flood events over time.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Their latest study found this also extended to businesses.“Indeed, we found that decreases in firms’ income is only found for cyclones, and not for floods,” the study said.As expected, some sectors fared much worse than others.In 2018 - the year that Cyclone Fehi and Cyclone Gita slammed into New Zealand - financial and insurance services suffered the worst profit losses from ex-tropical cyclones, at nearly $110 million.Read MoreThe Front Page: Adaptation vs mitigation – What should ...Climate change: NZ could face $24 billion bill to hit ...Analysis: Has this extreme summer really changed how ...Cyclone Gabrielle recovery package: ‘It will be a journey’ ...Government to splash $941m in Budget to rebuild communities ...Stopbanks, roads and local response key factors in ...Cyclone Gabrielle: Forestry put ‘bread and butter’ ...That compared with the $15m hit that agriculture, forestry and fishing-linked industries took - and the $13m and $7m combined profit losses respectively recorded by the wholesale trade sector and transport, postal and warehousing firms.For wildfire impacts, the researchers looked solely at the forestry sector - and were surprised to find no discernible impact on forestry firms.While the analysis didn’t cover any years past 2020, Noy said the sheer scale of recent disasters like Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland floods - each bearing extreme features expected to become more common under climate change - would have translated to wider sector costs.“Bigger events have bigger impacts on each affected firm because they don’t only affect your own firm and your immediate surroundings, but also all the firms you are connected to, and all your customers and suppliers,” Noy said.Overall, Noy said the heavy costs from weather disasters observed in the study supported the need for financial support to help businesses recover.“However, that support needs to be designed appropriately so it does not lead to further undue risk-taking and worst outcomes in terms of future resilience,” he said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“It also suggests that post-disaster assistance should be selective in whom it helps - and be need-based, rather than provide a blanket assistance programme for all firms in an affected region, which sometimes seems to be the preferred policy.”He pointed out that some commercial entities - such as many construction firms - actually saw boosts in income following disasters.“There are clearly further questions around what kinds of interventions or actions - by government, businesses, or even insurers and investors - can ameliorate these adverse impacts and improve outcomes for individuals and for businesses,” he said.“Ultimately, climate change is, for the time being, something we need to learn to live with - while also trying to prevent it from deteriorating further.”SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandPremiumNew ZealandSome kiwifruit growers in financial strife after 'catastrophic' season03 Jun 08:00 PMNew ZealandUpdatedKaikohe homicide: Cellphone video may have captured fatal home invasion03 Jun 07:30 PMNew ZealandFour injured, one critically, in Auckland crash03 Jun 07:00 PMNew Zealand'Heartbreaking': Doctor's plea - why are newborns not being screened for this disorder?03 Jun 06:00 PMCafé built on family food - and lovesponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

Video / NZ Herald ...The Act Party’s “Alternative Budget” proposes a two-rate income tax system and hundreds of millions of dollars to increase capacity in New Zealand prisons for both adults and young people.Party leader David Seymour is unveiling his Budget, “A Time for Truth”, in Auckland today as an alternative to the Government’s Budget to be released on Thursday.It contains the latest iteration of Act’s long-standing policy for a two-rate income tax system.Under the system, those earning less than $70,000 would pay 17.5 per cent from the next financial year.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Korowai Manaaki is a Youth Justice Residence, located in Manurewa, Auckland. Photo / Michael Craig.Those who earned more and currently paid either 33 per cent or 39 per cent would be downgraded in stages to 28 per cent by the beginning of the 2025/26 year.To offset the higher bottom tax rate, Act would introduce a tax credit for low and middle-income households, alongside a personal carbon tax refund from the revenue earned through the Emissions Trading Scheme of almost $250 in 2024 and falling slightly to $186 in 2027.Prison capacity would be another area receiving a significant funding boost under Act. The Department of Corrections would be resourced to hold 524 more prisoners up to a total capacity increase of 2094 by 2026/27.Corrections would also be given the responsibility of managing youth offenders. This currently sits with Oranga Tamariki. Act aims to build 200 specialised youth justice beds, costing about $500 million in capital expenditure.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.This year’s Alternative Budget includes an increase in Defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP, like last year, which Seymour said would bring New Zealand into line with its allies. That would mean $7.6 billion in extra capital expenditure over the next four years, almost double what Labour would spend, according to figures from last year.Other longstanding policies in Act’s Alternative Budget include performance-based pay for teachers and the gradual increase of the superannuation age to 67 at a rate of two months per year from the 2023/24 financial year before being indexed to life expectancy.Several programmes intended to reduce carbon emissions would be cut, including the Climate Change Commission, the Clean Car Discount and Climate Emergency Response Fund spending.The same goes for several ministries and other entities - all of the Ministry for Women, Ministry for Pacific Peoples, Ministry for Māori Development (Te Puni Kōkiri), Ministry for Ethnic Communities, Office for Māori-Crown Relations (Te Arawhiti) and the Human Rights Commission would be abolished.Read MoreAct Party’s Brooke van Velden targets National Party’s ...Fed Farmers president Andrew Hoggard running for Act ...Act Party leader David Seymour shows support for embattled ...Labour overtakes National in new political poll - Greens ...“Kiwis need lower, flatter taxes, paid for by reducing wasteful spending,” Seymour said in a statement.“We need to scrap government departments that don’t add value. We need less red tape on hardworking New Zealanders.“We’ve been poorly served by two major political parties who each say the other is ruining the country but will run it the same way if it gets them into office.“Our country will face a real choice in five months’ time, between parties offering more of the same and one promising real change.”SaveshareShare this articlefacebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail63Comments63CommentsJoin the conversation$1.50per weekSubscribe to commentRegister to read commentsAlready have an account?

Wellington motorists have been outraged by protesters who glue their hands to the road. They may not be much mollified to know they’re caught up in a worldwide debate. In the United States, Europe, Australia
and especially in Britain, climate-action protesters are struggling with the question: with time fast running out, how do you stop carbon emissions?
Protest has to be part of it, right? And it has to be non-violent. Right? But how and why and what?Non-violent direct action has always been part of the climate movement. Nearly 20 years ago, a British group called Planet Stupid used to run on to airport runways. Good name: it makes you laugh even if you’re furious your plane is delayed.And for far longer than that, Greenpeace has been trying to shut down the enemies of the environment: whaling ships, oil-drilling vessels, shareholder meetings of companies that fund the destruction. Their protests are targeted, high-profile and, especially at sea, have often involved considerable bravery and personal risk.Photographer Fernando Pereira died for his beliefs when, in an act of state terrorism, the French Government bombed the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland in 1984. These days, in Brazil, parts of Asia and elsewhere, climate activists are often killed.Keep up with the latest in lifestyle and entertainmentGet the latest lifestyle & entertainment headlines straight to your inbox.Please email me competitions, offers and other updates.

Extinction Rebellion, known as XR, was committed to extremely disruptive public action. Taking inspiration from the suffragists and other radical activists of the past, they glued their hands to motorways and splashed a lot of red paint around.They went to the headquarters of Barclays Bank, which finances several billion pounds of fossil-fuel extraction each year, and smashed the windows. “In case of climate emergency, break glass,” read the stickers they stuck to the shattered panes.XR also engaged in mass action: in two periods of sustained mass action on the streets of London in 2019 - 1130 and then 1832 people were arrested.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.In one way the XR theory was simple: the sooner everyone understands the climate crisis will affect them personally, the sooner we will agree to stop the emissions. So protest has to affect everyone. This is the idea that underpins the Restore Passenger Rail protests in Wellington.Restore Passenger Rail protesters block The Terrace in Wellington on May 1. Photo / Melissa NightingaleIn court, XR members have argued they have a moral imperative to act, and that argument has been surprisingly successful with juries and even judges. Public opinion in Britain is solidly in favour of reducing emissions and taking the climate crisis more seriously.But while there’s support for the cause, there’s no evidence the disruptive protests have strengthened that support. As in Wellington, XR has been confronted by furious motorists. In one notorious case when protesters climbed on to the roof of a train, they fought with commuters who attempted to haul them down. That was a bad look.Still, XR has tried to avoid violence against the public. This hasn’t stopped the real opponents of climate action from demonising them.A right-wing think tank called Policy Exchange, funded by ExxonMobil to fight climate activism, has called XR an extremist organisation that should be criminalised. And the British Government has passed punitive laws against disruptive protests, prompted by a report by Policy Exchange, with which it has close ties.On New Year’s Eve last year, XR released a statement called “We Quit”. They said they had decided to “temporarily shift away from public disruption as a primary tactic” and, instead, focus on peaceful mass protest that “prioritise attendance over arrest and relationships over roadblocks”.XR wants to build public support. Other radical groups, like Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain, responded by recommitting to public disruption.Insulate Britain? The name refers to a campaign to upgrade home insulation. The group is like Restore Passenger Rail: climate activists with specific, local, achievable demands.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Just Stop Oil is a bit different: they’re famous for throwing cans of tomato soup at paintings in galleries. And they stick their hands to the walls.This is disruptive and very high-profile, but they aren’t vandals: they choose paintings behind glass. It’s also symbolic: the message is that life is not an aesthetic experience and we have to stop pretending everything is fine just because we still have nice things.Just Stop Oil was prominent among the protesters at the coronation last weekend.As for XR, it’s also active here. And in case you’re thinking in stereotypes, it’s not a movement of student radicals: most of its prominent members are elderly.WHO’S RIGHT? When time’s running out fast, how do you change the world?In sociology, it’s called “the activist’s dilemma”. You know decisive action is required but you also want to build widespread public support. How do you do both?One answer is: across the movement, you do everything.Indigo Rumbelow, who co-founded Just Stop Oil, puts it this way: “The debate is not between those who want to take ‘moderate’ or ‘radical’ action. It’s between those who are standing by doing nothing at all, and those who are doing something. That’s where the line is drawn.”It’s an ecosystem, with each part playing a role. There’s even evidence that while radical action attracts some people, it also helps more moderate groups gain support. You might not support the people gluing their hands to the road, but you want to do something meaningful, so you join Forest and Bird.Police talk to Extinction Rebellion protesters in central Wellington as roads are blocked by the protests in October 2019.

Not everyone buys it. Andreas Malm is a Swedish academic and activist who argues that fossil-fuel corporates are not going to give up their profits voluntarily, so they have to be stopped. His most famous book is called How to Blow Up a Pipeline.Malm dismisses the soup-throwing and the hand-gluing, the marching in the streets and even the “blah blah blah” of Greta Thunberg. He’s been there and done that – he was a protester at the very first COP, in Berlin in 1995 – and he’s decided none of it works. Malm believes in sabotage.That is, destroying equipment at coal mines, as has happened to a small degree in Germany, and physically preventing the construction of oil pipelines, as Sioux tribes have tried to do at Standing Rock in North Dakota.Malm has traced the history of emancipation, through slavery, votes for women, American civil rights and many other movements, and decided that all such struggles, when successful, contain a common element: violence.He doesn’t mean killing people. But he does mean the destruction of property. “When do we start physically attacking the things that consume our planet and destroy them with our own hands? Is there a good reason we have waited this long?”He asks whether it is “possible to locate even one minimally relevant analogue to the climate struggle that has not contained some violence”.Very few people in the climate movement or anywhere else want to accept that. So the question becomes: If violence is not the answer, hadn’t we better come up with something that is?How to Blow Up a Pipeline is a movie now. It’s a drama, not a documentary, about a disparate bunch of activists in Texas who act out the sabotage promoted in the book, and it’s been getting some strong reviews. Not available here yet.Malm has unsettled quite a few people in the climate movement. The Guardian writer George Monbiot, usually regarded as a radical himself, worries about a government and corporate backlash: “A campaign of violence,” he warns, could “create a monster much bigger than you are: a monster that will close down the last chance of saving Earth systems.“My own belief,” he says, “is that our best hope is to precipitate a social tipping: widening the concentric circles of those committed to systemic change until a critical threshold is reached, that flips the status quo.”Monbiot thinks that tipping point is only about 25 per cent of the population. It’s an achievable goal, he suggests, but it will be less achievable if violent conflict is involved.CLIMATE ACTION is about far more than protest. As Monbiot implies, it’s about how we live, in our homes and our communities, and how we engage with the world.We all confront this now. Almost every part of New Zealand has been hit heavily by cyclones, floods, droughts and/or wildfires, often more than once.We’re looking for new answers about where it’s safe to live and how to make sure those places stay safe. How to look after each other in local communities. How to evolve an economy vulnerable to the ravages of wild weather. How to bring our emissions tumbling down.Everywhere you look, people are coming up with exciting answers.Jade Kake (Ngāpuhi, Te Whakatōhea, Te Arawa) is an architectural designer who works on papakāinga or village projects in Whangārei. As she explains in her book Rebuilding the Kāinga, she helps mana whenua re-establish themselves in communal living on ancestral land.For Kake, papakāinga represents “the development of new integrated housing, social and economic models for living today, based on how Māori used to live in the past”. Homes with communal facilities, where different generations look after each other, and where people work together and share in the economic prosperity that allows.It’s not for everyone, she says. But perhaps it is for more people than you might think.She also says, “While our social aims should be radical, our tactics are necessarily pragmatic, because we need to be effective.”What about the personal response? Shaun Hendy, well-known for his Covid modelling work during the pandemic, is the chief scientist at Toha. It’s a company that operates “a marketplace for environmental action”, but in 2018 Hendy took on his own challenge: he stopped flying.Not an easy thing, for a scientist in demand both at home and abroad. But you don’t discover much or change much when the challenge is easy. Hendy wanted to see if he could seriously disrupt his life and still come out on top. His book about it is called #NoFly.Max Harris, an equity campaigner and lawyer, is dedicated to the intellectual grunt work of progressive change. Harris wrote The New Zealand Project, which contains a sea of stimulating proposals on everything from justice to gender relations, taxation to trade.Harris wants to see far-reaching economic reform, greater engagement of local communities, a rethink of local and central government roles – and protest that generates a desire for change. This is Kake’s work, writ large.I’m chairing a panel discussion with Hendy, Harris and Kake during the Auckland Writers Festival. We’ll also have Carisa Showden with us. She’s a co-author of the inspirational Fierce Hope: Youth Activism in Aotearoa, a book that loops us straight back to the question of how to protest and why.Because, how are we going to get those emissions down?“But What Can We Do?” Auckland Writers Festival, 5.30pm Thursday, May 18, Kiri Te Kanawa Theatre, Aotea Centre. writersfestival.co.nzUnlock this article and all of our Herald Premium content by subscribing to NZ Herald Premium$1.50per weekSee all offersAlready a subscriber? Sign in hereSaveshareShare this articleReminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.facebookcopy linktwitterlinkedinredditemail AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from LifestyleLifestyleFlavour fusion: Quick-to-table recipes from Lara Lee’s A Splash of Soy03 Jun 08:00 PMPremiumLifestyleNanogirl Dr Michelle Dickinson on being a new mum and the challenges of IVF03 Jun 07:16 PMLifestyleEthically Kate: Top tips for being sustainable on holiday03 Jun 07:00 PMLifestyle'Fixated on what others were eating': Kiwi tells of overcoming anorexia03 Jun 06:00 PMOn Trend: My Food Bag introduces a Taste of KoreasponsoredMost PopularNew ZealandUpdated'They tricked me': Scam victim who lost $330k feels he’s failed his children and wife03 Jun 06:00 PMEntertainment'They f***** us': Tova O’Brien doubles down on comments while accepting award03 Jun 08:06 AMPremiumNew ZealandUpdatedFrom Mongrel Mob terror to lawyer: A Kiwi kid's life with a meth-addicted mother03 Jun 06:00 PMAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.

""I want this to be a long-term job.""  To make her point, Bhalla and a group of her peers recently delivered manila envelopes with mock job applications to the Delta, B.C., constituency office of Carla Qualtrough, the federal minister of employment, disability inclusion and workforce development. The stunt had a theatrical flair but was intended to convey a serious message: young people want green jobs, and those jobs could help Canada meet its climate commitments. ""We want to do jobs that we know are good for society, for the planet,"" Bhalla said.The group is calling on the federal government to spend $1 billion to create a ""Youth Climate Corps,"" a program that would offer two-year paid placements for Canadians under the age of 35 to train and work at climate-related jobs.The campaign, based loosely on historic efforts to address other crises such as the Great Depression, originated with the Climate Emergency Unit, a project of the David Suzuki Institute aimed at pushing Canada to confront climate change. Shake Up the Establishment, a climate justice non-profit co-founded by Bhalla, has been backing the Youth Climate Corps campaign, soliciting cover letters from young Canadians for jobs they believe are needed in their communities to help cut emissions and adapt to the changing climate.Among the approximately 100 submissions the group delivered to Qualtrough were applications for ""aspirational"" jobs across the country in conservation, clean energy, wildfire response and transit infrastructure. Bhalla said the range of jobs needed to address climate change is broader than some might imagine. ""A lot of the kind of work that really needs to be done, it doesn't always look like a climate job,"" she said. ""It looks like something that's helping build resiliency within our communities … that could look like working on issues like poverty, racism and other societal inequities. Those kinds of jobs maybe don't scream 'climate,' but they're what's needed to ensure no one gets left behind.""One group that supports the campaign is Youth Climate Corps BC, which has been doing exactly this kind of work since 2020. Run by an environmental non-profit, the program pays young people a living wage to work at climate-related summer jobs. The program has hired youth in smaller B.C. cities such as Nelson and Cranbrook and is working toward hiring a cohort in Vancouver for the first time this summer. Sam Kutyauripo, the program's Vancouver co-ordinator, said many young people are experiencing high levels of climate anxiety — something she believes the climate corps program helps manage. ""I think the good thing about this program is giving young people tangible ways to make meaningful changes in communities,"" she said. ""In turn, that is actually going to make them feel much better."" Kutyauripo said the small B.C.-based program is ""proof of concept"" that a larger national campaign would work.Qualtrough and Marci Ien, the federal minister for women, gender equality and youth, declined a CBC interview request about the Youth Climate Corps campaign. But the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change sent a statement highlighting several federal programs aimed at getting young people jobs, internships and volunteer opportunities. ""We applaud these individuals for their commitment to change,"" the statement read, in part. ""We need youth perspectives to ensure Canada's transition to a prosperous and low-carbon future is sustainable and inclusive.""— Rachel SandersReader feedbackLast week, we wrote about recent protests at Geneva Airport over the continued use of private jets. Bern Classen responded:""This planet has finite resources, and the rich are taking far more than a fair share!

We certainly do, and to answer that question, we published a new project pulling current and historical weather data for around 500 locations in Canada. We're calling it the CBC News Climate Dashboard.On your first visit to the page, you can set your default location by typing in your postal code or searching for a city. This location will then be shown first the next time you visit the page. The dashboard continuously updates with real-time data.At the top of the dashboard, you will find an interactive globe showing the temperature records for the day across Canada. The content below will give you more information on a specific location: current conditions as well as hourly and daily forecasts.If you keep scrolling, you will see the historical trends. How many days were above 0 C last winter? Are the number of days above 30 C above average this spring? Were the previous 30 days extremely hot compared to the historical average? The answers are in the dashboard.And at the bottom of the page, you can explore the latest temperature projections up to the year 2100, with different scenarios.For now, the Climate Dashboard focuses on temperatures. But we will add more variables, like precipitation, in the coming months — so it's worth adding the page to your favourites.— Naël Shiab, senior data producer for CBC News (CBC)Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web Whether for reasons of style or environmental sustainability, there's a growing movement of people who don't wash their clothing. Methane leaks from the two main fossil fuel fields in Turkmenistan are so vast, environmental activists say that fixing this would be a massive climate win for the entire planet. The U.S. is working with the Asian country to address this issue. Plugging the leak could stop about 83 million tonnes of CO2 from going into the atmosphere each year, according to calculations done by Bloomberg Green. Climate change has many impacts. One of them is the growing reluctance of the insurance industry to cover losses in highly vulnerable areas, such as California. This week, State Farm, California's biggest home insurer, said it would no longer issue new policies in the state, which is becoming synonymous with raging wildfires. How wildfires are changing in Canada (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press)The wildfires that have ripped through parts of the Maritimes and Western Canada this spring are part of an overall rise in more powerful fires, experts say. But the details behind this trend are more complex than just counting the fires, or damage done, per year. CBC News reviewed historical data to get a sense of the changing nature of wildfires, and the role of climate change, in the country. (Canada started collecting wildfire data in 1950, although the first decade's figures are thought to be less reliable.)  The chart below shows that the number of annual wildfires has, in fact, been declining since the 1980s.Experts attribute this to improved fire prevention — so the number of human-caused fires is going down.This is thanks to better education and fire bans, says Mike Flannigan, one of the country's foremost experts on wildfires, who also reviewed the data.At the same time, the fires that break out now tend to burn more territory. Overall, the area burned annually by wildland fires has more than doubled since the 1970s, according to a recent federal report. The next chart shows the number of burned hectares by decade.The trend is ""not just a straight line. It's a bumpy path,"" Flannigan says. ""There is a large year-to-year variability because of weather and ignition."" The recipe for a wildfire has three ingredients — ignition (either lightning or humans), fuel (dried grasses, shrubs, trees and other vegetation) and dry weather, he says.But the particulars of those three ingredients are changing, along with the climate.  In Canada, roughly half of all fires are now caused by lightning. But lightning strikes are on the rise and expected to further increase with climate change.Because of climate change, the vegetation is more likely to be dry and more flammable.""As the temperature increases, the ability of the atmosphere to suck moisture out of the fuel increases almost exponentially,"" says Flannigan. ""Unless you get more rain to compensate for this drying effect from the warming, you end up with drier fuels. And this is a really critical aspect of the fire world.""Finally, that same hot and dry weather — particularly on windy days — contributes to the likelihood of wildfire spreading more widely. The disastrous 2016 fire in Fort McMurray, Alta., for example, came as an unusually hot and dry system settled over northern Alberta that May.The opposite is also true. For instance, between 2000 and 2009, it was unusually cool in the Northwest Territories, which led to a lower overall burned area, Flannigan says.In general, fires are also happening earlier in the year because of the increasingly early spring thaw, and ending later in the year, Flannigan says.A rise in major fires has also led to more evacuations, given the fires' growing size and the growing population. The next chart shows the rise in people displaced by fires.The Fort McMurray fire displaced 80,000 people — one of the largest evacuations in Canadian history.Such fires can also threaten critical infrastructure, such as power lines and major industrial sites like the oilsands, says Kelsey Copes-Gerbitz, a postdoctoral fire researcher at University of British Columbia who also reviewed the data.Experts use another category, ""fire disasters,"" to indicate especially significant fires. A fire disaster must meet at least one of these conditions:  10 or more people killed.  100 or more people injured, relocated, infected, displaced or homeless.  Authorities appeal for national or international assistance.  Historical significance.  Causes significant damage to a community. Fire disasters are on the rise.Overall, the period covered by the data was when Canada tried, for the most part, to suppress all wildfires, Copes-Gerbitz says. Now, she says, ""climate change is really pushing us to a place where we can no longer suppress all fires and be guaranteed in our success for suppression.""Experts say improved fire management — for instance by allowing some fires to burn and increasing the number of prescribed burns (such as Indigenous cultural burns) — would help reduce the number of out-of-control, large-scale fires.An increased emphasis on community-level fire safety, and better oversight of what kind of trees are planted — some are better able to resist or recover from fires — would also help. ""That kind of approach will help us reduce the area that a fire can burn,"" said Copes-Gerbitz.— Benjamin Shingler and Graeme BruceStay in touch!Are there issues you'd like us to cover?

See how they compare to historical trendsA new study shows it also makes a big difference in the carbon cycle — that is, the balance created by carbon being absorbed by ecosystems and then returned to the atmosphere through decomposition. Unfortunately, tree diversity is on the decline on a global scale, and is a particular problem in Canada.""In Canadian forests, as compared to temperate and tropical forests, tree diversity is low,"" said Scott Chang, a professor of renewable resources at the University of Alberta. But around the world, tree diversity ""has been decreasing due to human interference, global climate change, harvesting of forests and so forth,"" he added.So what does tree diversity mean, how does the carbon cycle fit in and what does it look like in Alberta?CBC ExplainsClimate change is warming Canada's great expanse of boreal forest, bringing greater risk of fire and diseaseDefining diversityTree diversity is a term used to describe three specific qualities in our forest environment, according to Chang. The first two qualities are species richness, which is measured by the number of trees in an area, and evenness, which Chang describes as how equally the species are distributed. The last factor comes down to the actual trees and the different functions they perform in a forest. Tree diversity can refer to the number of trees in an area, how evenly the species are distributed and the trees' physical characteristics.  (Caitlin Hanson/CBC)""Some of them have bigger leaves, some have small leaves, and those are a measure of function,"" Chang said. ""So how diverse are those different functions?"" Different species of trees have distinct physical characteristics; in turn, those characteristics give them different capacities to adapt to certain challenges — and that ensures the forest is resilient to stress, said Devon Earl, an environmental scientist and conservation specialist with Alberta Wilderness Association. ""That's really important for populations when we have things like climate change, where their environment is changing really quickly,"" she said.Mitigation on top of adaptationWhile maintaining forest biodiversity helps to improve resilience to climate change, diversity can also help to mitigate further warming, according to a new study on carbon storage in natural forests across Canada, published by Nature in April.  ""This is the first study to demonstrate that tree diversity can increase soil carbon sequestration in natural forests,"" said Chang. The study looked at data over an almost 20-year period, and included hundreds of forest plots scattered across the country. Through that data, soil carbon and nitrogen changes were monitored over time. Those values indicate the importance of carbon storage and forest fertility, as more nitrogen supports more growth. According to the study, increasing species evenness increases soil carbon and nitrogen by 30 and 42 per cent respectively. Increasing the functional diversity — that is, the variety of physical characteristics within the forest — enhanced soil carbon and nitrogen by 32 and 50 per cent, respectively.""More diverse trees can uptake more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that will mitigate the global change and also it could increase the nitrogen — you know, reduce nitrogen loss from the forest,"" said Xinli Chen, a postdoctoral student and lead author on the study. Chen said that more diverse forests often have more biomass production. Factors like root depth and canopy height play a role in how forests grow and thrive, he added.Different heights in the canopy and root depths can improve growth and carbon sequestration, according to Chen. (CBC)""They can take more resources from the ecosystem,"" he said. ""So this means they can grow better … and it means they can take more carbon from the atmosphere.""Management practices need changeChang said the study opens the door for embracing tree diversity as a means of climate change mitigation in Canada. ""We need to put in more efforts to conserve biodiversity because biodiversity comes with many different benefits,"" he said. Chang said that the implications from this research should be implemented in the Canadian government's ""2 Billion Trees Commitment,"" an initiative that is working to help organizations plant two billion trees in Canada over the next decade.Ottawa reveals its latest plan to plant 2 billion trees by 2030""If they can use multiple tree species for instructing those tree plantings instead of just a single tree species, there is a potential benefit that can be gained to increase carbon sequestration,"" Chang said.Planting a variety of tree species could be beneficial in mitigating climate change, according to Chang. (Kristy Nease/CBC)Earl said that in Alberta, she hasn't seen an uptake in tree diversity, especially in managed forests. In fact, there's evidence that things can move in the opposite direction.""One thing that is happening with tree diversity in Alberta is that we're seeing forest management practices that sort of reduce diversity of trees in forests,"" she said. According to Earl, after an area is logged, forestry companies tend to plant a single species that they want to cut again in the future. In addition, she said, companies will often use the herbicide glyphosate to suppress the growth of deciduous trees and other plants.""They just want to have that one species of tree growing back that they want to harvest again and they don't want that tree species to have any competition for things like light and soil nutrients,"" she said. Earl said that allowing those deciduous trees to grow in replanted cutblocks benefit the wildlife but also help with our increased risk of wildfire as our climate changes. She said that deciduous trees such as aspen are less likely to burn, and when they do, they burn less intensely. ""It's really important to have these trees in the forest that are less likely to burn intensely and can act as sort of a break.""Our planet is changing. So is our journalism. This story is part of a CBC News initiative entitled ""Our Changing Planet"" to show and explain the effects of climate change.

I love my electric car but I didn't realize my life would revolve around charging it | CBC News

But it’s become a bigger lifestyle decision than she had anticipated.I was motivated by the climate crisis facing our worldAkiko Hara  · for CBC First Person  · Posted: May 31, 2023 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: May 31Akiko Hara often faces long waits to charge her electric vehicle unless she goes early in the morning or late at night. (Submitted by Akiko Hara)This First Person column is written by Akiko Hara, who lives in Vancouver. For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see the FAQ.Not again. All the electric vehicle charging stations were taken, and I knew I was in for at least a 30- to 40-minute wait. And yet, the app on my phone showed two chargers had been available five minutes ago. I had driven in this pouring rain for nothing, but what choice did I have? My EV needed charging for the next day's commute, and this was the closest station to my home.When my old Hyundai Elantra received a death sentence at the repair shop in 2019, I decided that my new vehicle was going to be electric. Up until then, I had cared for the Earth by doing small things, such as using reusable grocery bags and recycling plastic and paper products. I wanted to do more. The demise of my gas-powered vehicle presented a perfect opportunity. I looked forward to driving a car that did not emit pollution or run on fossil fuel.  The fact that my condo wasn't equipped with an EV charger didn't seem a big obstacle. Considering the support from the provincial government and the increasing number of electric cars every year, I presumed that it would be only a matter of time before we installed chargers in our underground parking. Meanwhile, I could use public charging stations that were popping up around my neighbourhood. The price range of electric vehicles dampened my initial excitement. I couldn't afford any of them. Determined, I looked into second-hand EVs, and voila! There were plenty on the market. With a loan, I could afford one. After a month of research and field study, I purchased a second-hand 2016 Nissan Leaf. I was happy. I loved the ""coulis red"" colour and the slightly nerdy look of its bug-eyed headlights. What I enjoyed the most was how quietly it glided on the road. Zero emission gave me peace of mind that I made the right choice for a world facing climate change. I never missed the roaring of the engine or the smell of the gasoline. My first year of EV ownership was great. I utilized public EV chargers, most of which were free at that time, and enjoyed impromptu conversations with fellow EV drivers I met at the charging stations. ""Excuse me, no rush, but I'm just wondering how long you might be here.""""Oh, just about ten more minutes?""Then we'd carry on with our conversation, mostly talking about our EVs.  ""Nissan Leaf? How do you like it?""""I love it."" Are today's temperatures normal? See how they compare to historical trendsWhat on Earth?Demand for battery minerals is increasing — how can we keep up?What can we expect from clean hydrogen in Canada?CBC News: The House10:48A new auto industry is taking shape. How much will it cost Canada?The federal government has already invested half a billion dollars in an electric vehicle battery plant in Windsor, but construction screeched to a halt this week after the automaker demanded more. Host Catherine Cullen asks Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland whether further spending on the plant is a fair deal for Canadians.Around the second year, the quest for charging started to become more frustrating than enjoyable. Significantly more people were driving EVs, which was encouraging. But this also meant that the chargers in my neighbourhood were almost always unavailable unless I got there before 7 a.m. or after 10 p.m. After repeated incidents of disappointment, I stopped checking the availability online beforehand. The charger that showed as ""available"" online was often taken by the time I got there.    In 2021, my strata council proposed spending $5,000 to assess the building's underground parking for suitability to install EV chargers. I was excited. I felt optimistic this would be approved easily.   At the annual general meeting, a few hands went up when questions and comments were invited before voting. One resident expressed his opposition to the idea of paying $5,000 to the consulting company just to get their advice. I saw some nodding heads. Another resident proposed that we could make the charger available to the public and make some money out of it. Not wanting to appear selfish by advocating for my own convenience, I kept my hand down and quietly listened to the different opinions. Just before the chair called for voting, another hand went up. She hesitated before speaking. But once she began, she expressed her opinion forcefully. ""Electric vehicles are expensive,"" she said. ""I can't afford it. Why would we support those few who can afford expensive cars? We should use money for something that benefits all of us, not just those who are affluent enough to purchase an electric car."" I let her opinion sink in. Was I arrogant to assume that everyone would be supportive of having EV chargers in our building?  The proposal was defeated.  The number of electric cars in Canada is rising every year. (Tobias Schwarz/Getty Images)That night, I couldn't sleep. Not because of my neighbour's bitter comment, but because I suddenly remembered my intention for buying an EV in the first place. I should have spoken up. Greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide, climate crisis ... These words jumbled in my head. Nobody had even mentioned this life-or-death issue we all are facing. I could have at least shared my story. That I got my EV because I wanted to do a little more to protect the environment where we humans and all other species live. That I was in favour of the strata proposal not just for my own convenience, but to support future EV owners and to encourage those who are concerned about the sustainable earth. The fact our condo has a good recycling system in place is a sign that many of us do care. Given that, I wondered, if I had spoken up, would that have changed the outcome of the vote? Two years later, our condo remains unequipped with an EV charger. Getting access to the public chargers in Vancouver seems to get harder every month. Still, I adore my earth-friendly, bug-eyed, coulis-red Leaf and have never regretted my decision to switch to an EV. While driving an EV might be just one of many ways to reduce the ongoing harm to the earth, I do wish that things were much easier.  Do you have a compelling personal story that can bring understanding or help others? We want to hear from you. Here's more info on how to pitch to us.ABOUT THE AUTHORAkiko HaraFreelance contributorAkiko Hara is a Vancouver-based writer.

(Equinor)Canada's first deep water oil project has been shelved for three years ""in the face of challenging market conditions,"" according to Norwegian oil giant Equinor.The company sent a news release shortly after noon on Wednesday, in the midst of the Energy N.L. Conference and Exhibition in St. John's.""We will utilize this postponement to continue to actively mature Bay du Nord towards a successful development,"" said Tore Løseth, head of Equinor Canada.A spokesperson said the project has incurred ""significant cost increases"" in recent months, due in part to a volatile market.Trond Bokn, senior vice-president of project development, said the project is still important for Equinor.""We will now look at the project again to see if we can do further optimizations to our concept and strategies,"" Bokn said.Bay du Nord is made of up five oil discoveries. Equinor said it is continuing to assess exploration drilling around the field in 2024.""Canada is one of Equinor's core areas and through both our partner-operated assets and Bay du Nord, we maintain a very strong business in the country,"" said Løseth. ""We are also encouraged by the strong support in Newfoundland and Labrador and Canada for the project and look forward to the future development of Bay du Nord.""Yay and nayThe head of Energy N.L., Charlene Johnson, addressed the room during the industry conference shortly after Equinor broke the news Wednesday afternoon.""Clearly this is extremely disappointing news for everyone in this room, and the entire industry and our province,"" Johnson said, noting the project has already seen numerous delays already. Johnson said she has spoken with Løseth about her disappointment and concern. Løseth is scheduled to speak at the conference Thursday.Charlene Johnson, CEO of Energy N.L., says Equinor's news is 'extremely' disappointing for the entire industry and Newfoundland and Labrador.  (Ryan Cooke/CBC)Johnson said Energy N.L. will remain in contact with Equinor over the coming weeks and still feels there are reasons for optimism. ""This is just another bump in the road to what we still feel will be a successful project,"" she said.On the other side, Connor Curtis, head of communications with the Sierra Club Canada Foundation, told CBC News the delay speaks to the fact that ""the economics of this are uncertain.""Sierra Club Canada, along with 118 environmental and citizens' groups across Canada, have long been against the Bay du Nord project for environmental and economic reasons. In March 2020, they banded together to call on Ottawa to reject the project completely.""Because we're aiming to meet our climate target, really in the long-term that means that a lot of that oil would not be needed. So developing long-term reserves of fossil fuels like the oil and gas from projects off of Newfoundland and Labrador, including Bay du Nord, really doesn't make much sense,"" Curtis said.""I think to an extent we had questions about the viability of these projects for quite a long time,"" he said. ""I'm not really surprised by it, but to a certain extent I hope that this does send a message to the provincial government and to the federal government.""""They need to start rapidly decarbonizing N.L.'s economy. If they're betting the future of the economy on an expansion in oil and gas and doubling production of oil and gas, that's just not going to happen.

      Hurricane season starts today. Here’s what to expect

         — 
    


Hurricane season begins today, and while the outlooks have called for an average season, forecasters are warning that even typical years have the potential to lash coastal states with devastating storms. 
  

      Here’s what to expect in the coming months.
  

    How many hurricanes will there be?


      CNN tracked two hurricane season outlooks this year: the forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was released last week, and another from researchers at Colorado State University, who have been issuing seasonal forecasts for more than 37 years. 
  







      NOAA officials are predicting an average hurricane season, with 12 to 17 named tropical storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes. They expect as many of four of those could strengthen into major hurricanes – category 3 or stronger.
  






      Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State, said in April his group was predicting a slightly below-average season this year: 13 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes.
  

      The key difference between tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes lies in their wind speeds and the level of organization within the system.  
  








      While a tropical depression represents the earliest stage of cyclone development, named tropical storms exhibit more structure and stronger winds. Hurricanes — the most powerful and dangerous of the three — possess the strongest winds and a well-defined eye, making them capable of causing extensive damage over large areas.

    How many will make landfall?

      None of the seasonal outlooks go as far as to predict how many storms could make landfall in the Caribbean or the US. But history has shown that even in years with average or below-average storms, deadly landfalls are still possible. 
  

      Last year, for instance, was an average season, but Hurricane Ian was a catastrophe for Florida. The storm killed more than 100 people when it made landfall in September, devastated the coast around Fort Myers and caused inland flooding that lasted weeks. 
  

      Florida was then struck by Hurricane Nicole in November, which tore the beach out from under homes in Volusia County, leaving them teetering on the brink of collapse.
  

      There have been six category 4 or 5 hurricanes to hit the mainland since 2017, the most ever during a six-year period. Climate change, especially the buildup of heat increasing the ocean’s temperature, is leading to a larger percentage of hurricanes reaching the highest categories on the scale – a trend that is likely to continue as global temperatures climb. 
  

    What are the environmental factors at play this year?


      This hurricane season’s activity will largely depend on two competing factors: El Niño, which inhibits storm development, and near record-high ocean temperatures, which will help fuel hurricanes.
  

      El Niño is characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and tends to increase upper-level winds over the Atlantic, which disrupt and suppress hurricane formation.

Major bleaching is currently occurring on the coral reefs of the Society Islands in French Polynesia. The marine biologist teams of CRIOBE (Centre for Island Research and Environmental Observatory) are specialists in the study of coral ecosystems. They are currently working on ""resilient corals"", The teams of PhD Laetitia Hédouin identify, mark and perform genetic analysis of corals, which are not impacted by thermal stress. They then produce coral cuttings which are grown in a ""coral nursery"" and compared to other colonies studying the resilience capacity of coral. (Photo by Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty Images).

Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed




      El Niño’s influence on this season is still somewhat uncertain because it is only just beginning to develop. That it will eventually form this year is a “foregone conclusion,” Klotzbach told CNN last week.
  

      But there’s another factor that could negate or even outweigh El Niño’s influence this year: Sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are already at or near record-high levels, and in a way that “matches up quite well with what we associate with active Atlantic hurricane seasons,” Klotzbach said.
  

      “If these warm anomalies in the North Atlantic persist through the hurricane season, it has the potential to cause less of an El Niño (wind) shear impact than we normally see,” he said, and that possibility is even showing up in “several climate model forecasts” for the summer and fall. 
  

    How is climate change affecting hurricanes?


      Hurricanes are natural phenomena shaped by complex atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. But they are now increasingly influenced by human-caused climate change.  
  

      As our planet continues to warm due to fossil fuel pollution, the impacts are manifesting in the intensification and altered behavior of these destructive storms. Through a combination of warmer waters, increased atmospheric moisture and rising sea levels, the climate crisis has set the stage for hurricanes to pose unprecedented risks to coastal communities. 
  

    What names will the hurricanes have?


      The World Meteorological Organization chooses hurricane names and the list rotates every six years. Names are gendered alternately through the season, and the list excludes names starting with the letters Q, U, X, Y or Z. If there are more than 21 storms in a season, the names transition to the Greek alphabet. 
  

      Some names are retired after particularly devastating storms. “Ian” and “Fiona” were retired last year, for example, and 96 names have been retired from the list since 1953.

    When does hurricane season really get going?


      Hurricanes can form at any time during the warm season and late into fall, but on average they peak in the Atlantic in the early fall – which is also around the time that the strongest storms tend to make landfall in the US.
  

      Hurricane season ends on November 30, though there have been several instances where storms continued to form well after that date. In 2005 – the same year Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans – Hurricane Epsilon formed on November 29 and dissipated December 10. It was followed by an extremely late-season storm, Tropical Storm Zeta, that formed December 30 and lasted into January.

      Hurricane season starts today. Here’s what to expect

         — 
    


Hurricane season begins today, and while the outlooks have called for an average season, forecasters are warning that even typical years have the potential to lash coastal states with devastating storms. 
  

      Here’s what to expect in the coming months.
  

    How many hurricanes will there be?


      CNN tracked two hurricane season outlooks this year: the forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was released last week, and another from researchers at Colorado State University, who have been issuing seasonal forecasts for more than 37 years. 
  







      NOAA officials are predicting an average hurricane season, with 12 to 17 named tropical storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes. They expect as many of four of those could strengthen into major hurricanes – category 3 or stronger.
  






      Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State, said in April his group was predicting a slightly below-average season this year: 13 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes.
  

      The key difference between tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes lies in their wind speeds and the level of organization within the system.  
  








      While a tropical depression represents the earliest stage of cyclone development, named tropical storms exhibit more structure and stronger winds. Hurricanes — the most powerful and dangerous of the three — possess the strongest winds and a well-defined eye, making them capable of causing extensive damage over large areas.

    How many will make landfall?

      None of the seasonal outlooks go as far as to predict how many storms could make landfall in the Caribbean or the US. But history has shown that even in years with average or below-average storms, deadly landfalls are still possible. 
  

      Last year, for instance, was an average season, but Hurricane Ian was a catastrophe for Florida. The storm killed more than 100 people when it made landfall in September, devastated the coast around Fort Myers and caused inland flooding that lasted weeks. 
  

      Florida was then struck by Hurricane Nicole in November, which tore the beach out from under homes in Volusia County, leaving them teetering on the brink of collapse.
  

      There have been six category 4 or 5 hurricanes to hit the mainland since 2017, the most ever during a six-year period. Climate change, especially the buildup of heat increasing the ocean’s temperature, is leading to a larger percentage of hurricanes reaching the highest categories on the scale – a trend that is likely to continue as global temperatures climb. 
  

    What are the environmental factors at play this year?


      This hurricane season’s activity will largely depend on two competing factors: El Niño, which inhibits storm development, and near record-high ocean temperatures, which will help fuel hurricanes.
  

      El Niño is characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and tends to increase upper-level winds over the Atlantic, which disrupt and suppress hurricane formation.

Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed




      El Niño’s influence on this season is still somewhat uncertain because it is only just beginning to develop. That it will eventually form this year is a “foregone conclusion,” Klotzbach told CNN last week.
  

      But there’s another factor that could negate or even outweigh El Niño’s influence this year: Sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are already at or near record-high levels, and in a way that “matches up quite well with what we associate with active Atlantic hurricane seasons,” Klotzbach said.
  

      “If these warm anomalies in the North Atlantic persist through the hurricane season, it has the potential to cause less of an El Niño (wind) shear impact than we normally see,” he said, and that possibility is even showing up in “several climate model forecasts” for the summer and fall. 
  

    How is climate change affecting hurricanes?


      Hurricanes are natural phenomena shaped by complex atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. But they are now increasingly influenced by human-caused climate change.  
  

      As our planet continues to warm due to fossil fuel pollution, the impacts are manifesting in the intensification and altered behavior of these destructive storms. Through a combination of warmer waters, increased atmospheric moisture and rising sea levels, the climate crisis has set the stage for hurricanes to pose unprecedented risks to coastal communities. 
  

    What names will the hurricanes have?


      The World Meteorological Organization chooses hurricane names and the list rotates every six years. Names are gendered alternately through the season, and the list excludes names starting with the letters Q, U, X, Y or Z. If there are more than 21 storms in a season, the names transition to the Greek alphabet. 
  

      Some names are retired after particularly devastating storms. “Ian” and “Fiona” were retired last year, for example, and 96 names have been retired from the list since 1953.

    When does hurricane season really get going?


      Hurricanes can form at any time during the warm season and late into fall, but on average they peak in the Atlantic in the early fall – which is also around the time that the strongest storms tend to make landfall in the US.
  

      Hurricane season ends on November 30, though there have been several instances where storms continued to form well after that date. In 2005 – the same year Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans – Hurricane Epsilon formed on November 29 and dissipated December 10. It was followed by an extremely late-season storm, Tropical Storm Zeta, that formed December 30 and lasted into January.

      If climate goals are meant to protect us from ‘significant harm,’ then they aren’t good enough, scientists say

         — 
    


      For years, the world has been focusing on a key climate change threshold: limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But even at that threshold – which could begin to be breached within the next five years – millions of people will still face “significant harm,” including death, displacement and food and water scarcity, an international commission of researchers reported Wednesday.
  

      In a study published in the journal Nature, the panel of more than a dozen researchers integrated environmental justice – the idea that climate thresholds should minimize significant harm – with climate science. And with that standard, they found the world has already breached critical boundaries, leaving less safe, habitable space for life on Earth.  
  

      At 1.5 degrees Celsius, the authors found that more than 200 million people could still be exposed to unprecedented heat, and more than 500 million people would be exposed to longterm sea level rise. And they said that the key climate threshold nations pledged to meet in the Paris Agreement in 2015 – one that would ensure a “safe and just” world – should have been 1 degree Celsius.
  







      But the planet’s average temperature has already soared to around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, which has already triggered catastrophic and deadly climate and weather changes, including more extreme heat waves, floods and landscape-altering wildfires. 
  

      “Science is showing clearly that we are at risk of destabilizing the entire planet and its life support systems,” said Johan Rockström, the lead author on the study and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and co-chair of the Earth Commission.  
  

      “Unfortunately, the doctor will tell you that we are moving in the wrong direction on basically all of these living components that build up this complex, adaptive, self-regulating system,” he told reporters, likening the study to a doctor’s visit, and that the prescription is “a list of quantitative safe and just boundary conditions that you have to live within to be able to cure yourself.”  
  








      While past scientific efforts to define Earth’s boundaries have been strong and compelling, climate science has historically looked at the conditions needed to maintain the planet’s stability, but excluded justice as a key component, said Joyeeta Gupta, a co-author on the study and an environmental researcher at the University of Amsterdam.
  

      “We argue that there is no safe planet without justice,” Gupta said, underscoring that incorporating justice to the Earth system’s boundaries reduces significant harm to communities and individuals.

      The research is a “worthy attempt” to identify and quantify the human toll associated with different levels of environmental degradation, such as climate change, water availability and biodiversity, said Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved with the study but was a lead author on the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.
  

      “This paper highlights the human costs of the emissions choices we are making every single year – costs that will extend many generations into the future, when we do not move to enact emissions in line with the most ambitious targets,” Cobb told CNN. It also “provides further ammunition to climate justice advocates as policymakers seek a greater understanding of how continued warming will worsen existing climate injustices from region to region and across the next decades to centuries.” 
  

      Scientists are calling on governments, businesses and policymakers to take the crisis more seriously as climate thresholds are breached and the world gets warmer.  
  

      “The intention of this paper was to try and show that there is already a lot of damage at 1 degree, and that this is more just than a 1.5-degree target,” Gupta said. “We want to make sure that countries take this as seriously as possible.”

      If climate goals are meant to protect us from ‘significant harm,’ then they aren’t good enough, scientists say

         — 
    


      For years, the world has been focusing on a key climate change threshold: limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But even at that threshold – which could begin to be breached within the next five years – millions of people will still face “significant harm,” including death, displacement and food and water scarcity, an international commission of researchers reported Wednesday.
  

      In a study published in the journal Nature, the panel of more than a dozen researchers integrated environmental justice – the idea that climate thresholds should minimize significant harm – with climate science. And with that standard, they found the world has already breached critical boundaries, leaving less safe, habitable space for life on Earth.  
  

      At 1.5 degrees Celsius, the authors found that more than 200 million people could still be exposed to unprecedented heat, and more than 500 million people would be exposed to longterm sea level rise. And they said that the key climate threshold nations pledged to meet in the Paris Agreement in 2015 – one that would ensure a “safe and just” world – should have been 1 degree Celsius.
  







      But the planet’s average temperature has already soared to around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, which has already triggered catastrophic and deadly climate and weather changes, including more extreme heat waves, floods and landscape-altering wildfires. 
  

      “Science is showing clearly that we are at risk of destabilizing the entire planet and its life support systems,” said Johan Rockström, the lead author on the study and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and co-chair of the Earth Commission.  
  

      “Unfortunately, the doctor will tell you that we are moving in the wrong direction on basically all of these living components that build up this complex, adaptive, self-regulating system,” he told reporters, likening the study to a doctor’s visit, and that the prescription is “a list of quantitative safe and just boundary conditions that you have to live within to be able to cure yourself.”  
  








      While past scientific efforts to define Earth’s boundaries have been strong and compelling, climate science has historically looked at the conditions needed to maintain the planet’s stability, but excluded justice as a key component, said Joyeeta Gupta, a co-author on the study and an environmental researcher at the University of Amsterdam.
  

      “We argue that there is no safe planet without justice,” Gupta said, underscoring that incorporating justice to the Earth system’s boundaries reduces significant harm to communities and individuals.

      The research is a “worthy attempt” to identify and quantify the human toll associated with different levels of environmental degradation, such as climate change, water availability and biodiversity, said Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved with the study but was a lead author on the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.
  

      “This paper highlights the human costs of the emissions choices we are making every single year – costs that will extend many generations into the future, when we do not move to enact emissions in line with the most ambitious targets,” Cobb told CNN. It also “provides further ammunition to climate justice advocates as policymakers seek a greater understanding of how continued warming will worsen existing climate injustices from region to region and across the next decades to centuries.” 
  

      Scientists are calling on governments, businesses and policymakers to take the crisis more seriously as climate thresholds are breached and the world gets warmer.  
  

      “The intention of this paper was to try and show that there is already a lot of damage at 1 degree, and that this is more just than a 1.5-degree target,” Gupta said. “We want to make sure that countries take this as seriously as possible.”

      Shanghai records its highest May temperature in more than 100 years

         — 
    


      The Chinese city of Shanghai recorded its highest May temperature in more than 100 years on Monday, hitting a record 36.1 degrees Celsius (nearly 97 degrees Fahrenheit).  
  

      The previous record of 35.7 degrees Celsius (96.3 degrees Fahrenheit) was first recorded in May 1876 and has been reached just three other times since including 1903, 1915 and 2018, state media reported. 
  

      It is unknown when the city began keeping temperature records.  
  







      Monday’s record-breaking heat wave for May was recorded in the city’s Xuhui district, state media CCTV reported, citing the Shanghai Meteorological Department. 
  

      Earlier Monday, the Shanghai Meteorological Department issued its first high temperature alert of the year as temperatures in the city surpassed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for three consecutive days.  
  

      This comes after a heat wave swept through China in July, with residents resorting to air raid shelters and public fountains to stay cool. 
  








      Across the entirety of 2022, Shanghai recorded 50 days of temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius.
  

      Shanghai’s current temperature alert level is yellow, the lowest of the three tiers. 
  

      An orange warning comes into effect if the maximum temperature is expected to rise above 37 degrees Celsius within 24 hours, and red means temperatures are expected to reach over 40 degrees Celsius in the coming 24 hours.
  

      This comes amid a swathe of record high temperatures across Asia in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand’s capital earlier this month. Experts say the heat has been compounded by an intense smoggy season that has caused pollution levels to spike.

      Scientists have long warned that heat waves are set to get worse as the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis accelerate.
  

      The temperature of China’s coastal waters has also increased significantly due to global warming, and the rise in sea levels has accelerated, said Wang Hua, head of the marine forecasting and monitoring department at China’s Ministry of Natural Resources, last month.
  

      Shanghai, the country’s most developed and richest city, is located along this coastline. 
  

      Over the past four decades, rising sea levels along the Chinese coast have caused long-term effects, including the erosion of coastal ecosystems and the loss of tidal flats. They have also affected groundwater supply and increased the damage caused by storms, floods and salt tide intrusion, Wang said.

      Shanghai records its highest May temperature in more than 100 years

         — 
    


      The Chinese city of Shanghai recorded its highest May temperature in more than 100 years on Monday, hitting a record 36.1 degrees Celsius (nearly 97 degrees Fahrenheit).  
  

      The previous record of 35.7 degrees Celsius (96.3 degrees Fahrenheit) was first recorded in May 1876 and has been reached just three other times since including 1903, 1915 and 2018, state media reported. 
  

      It is unknown when the city began keeping temperature records.  
  







      Monday’s record-breaking heat wave for May was recorded in the city’s Xuhui district, state media CCTV reported, citing the Shanghai Meteorological Department. 
  

      Earlier Monday, the Shanghai Meteorological Department issued its first high temperature alert of the year as temperatures in the city surpassed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for three consecutive days.  
  

      This comes after a heat wave swept through China in July, with residents resorting to air raid shelters and public fountains to stay cool. 
  








      Across the entirety of 2022, Shanghai recorded 50 days of temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius.
  

      Shanghai’s current temperature alert level is yellow, the lowest of the three tiers. 
  

      An orange warning comes into effect if the maximum temperature is expected to rise above 37 degrees Celsius within 24 hours, and red means temperatures are expected to reach over 40 degrees Celsius in the coming 24 hours.
  

      This comes amid a swathe of record high temperatures across Asia in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand’s capital earlier this month. Experts say the heat has been compounded by an intense smoggy season that has caused pollution levels to spike.

      Scientists have long warned that heat waves are set to get worse as the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis accelerate.
  

      The temperature of China’s coastal waters has also increased significantly due to global warming, and the rise in sea levels has accelerated, said Wang Hua, head of the marine forecasting and monitoring department at China’s Ministry of Natural Resources, last month.
  

      Shanghai, the country’s most developed and richest city, is located along this coastline. 
  

      Over the past four decades, rising sea levels along the Chinese coast have caused long-term effects, including the erosion of coastal ecosystems and the loss of tidal flats. They have also affected groundwater supply and increased the damage caused by storms, floods and salt tide intrusion, Wang said.

         — 
    


      Dutch police arrested over 1,500 people after Extinction Rebellion protesters blocked a motorway in The Hague on Saturday.
  

      Hundreds of police were deployed to “maintain public order” during the climate protest, Dutch police said in a press release Saturday.
  

      According to police, shortly before midday local time, the activists descended upon the Utrechtsebaan (A12) motorway, after riot police prevented them for reaching “the underpass that they wanted to block.”
  







      The activists then began protesting in front of the police line, prompting police to “directly” and “repeatedly” ask them to leave, according to the press release.
  

      Extinction Rebellion Netherlands said that police deployed water cannons within 15 minutes of protesters blockading the A12 despite, according to the group, there being “no question of a dangerous or threatening situation.”

      Videos of the protest posted in social media showed protesters dressed in swimsuits and raincoats, prepared for the water cannons.
  








      Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, Raki Ap said in the statement that thousands of people had protested “on and next to the A12 with one demand: stop fossil fuel subsidies.”
  

      Dutch actress Carice van Outen, best known for her role as Melisandre in hit TV show, “Game of Thrones,” was reportedly hit by a water cannon and arrested by police at the protest, according to Dutch public broadcaster, NOS. Earlier on Saturday, van Outen posted a video on her Instagram page of musicians playing Beethoven, calling it a “peaceful and musical protest.”
  

      “Most of the activists, 1,539 people, were arrested for violating the Public Demonstrations Act,” the press release said, adding that the Public Prosecution Service will not be pursuing criminal action as it is only a minor criminal offense under Dutch law.
  

      Forty people were arrested for other criminal offenses including obstructing, blocking, vandalism, and insulting, according to the press release. One person was arrested for resisting arrest resulting in injury. These cases remain under review, according to the police.
  

    Arrests in Germany 


      The arrests in the Netherlands come after Germany’s authorities this week conducted a series of raids against the comparable climate activist group Last Generation.
  

      A total of 15 properties in seven German states were searched as part of the raids conducted on behalf of the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (LKA) and the Munich General Public Prosecutor’s Office, authorities said.
  

      The Prosecutor General’s Office in Munich said it had initiated a preliminary investigation “due to numerous criminal complaints from the population” against a total of seven defendants aged 22 to 38 years, “on the charge of forming or supporting a criminal organization.” 
  

      On Germany’s right, political figures were approving of the authorities’ crackdown on the climate group.
  

      The leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Party, Friedrich Merz, wrote on Twitter that causing “mass damage to property, graffiti or memorial plaques, or gluing oneself to the streets or cars are quite simply criminal offenses.” 
  

      He added, “It is correct that police and prosecutors are taking action against the Last Generation and those who finance it.”
  

      Some, though, questioned the move. Die Linke (The Left) Member of Parliament Lorenz Gosta Beutin told Bavarian broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk prosecutors were “putting themselves above our judiciary and courts.”
  

      A member of parliament for Germany’s Green Party, Helge Limburg, agreed that the “blanket assumption” of the group as criminal was legally questionable in an interview with Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
  

      The UK in 2020 threatened to class Extinction Rebellion as an organized crime group, which would have seen activists face jail terms of up to five years, although the plans did not come to fruition.

         — 
    


      Dutch police arrested over 1,500 people after Extinction Rebellion protesters blocked a motorway in The Hague on Saturday.
  

      Hundreds of police were deployed to “maintain public order” during the climate protest, Dutch police said in a press release Saturday.
  

      According to police, shortly before midday local time, the activists descended upon the Utrechtsebaan (A12) motorway, after riot police prevented them for reaching “the underpass that they wanted to block.”
  







      The activists then began protesting in front of the police line, prompting police to “directly” and “repeatedly” ask them to leave, according to the press release.
  

      Extinction Rebellion Netherlands said that police deployed water cannons within 15 minutes of protesters blockading the A12 despite, according to the group, there being “no question of a dangerous or threatening situation.”

      Videos of the protest posted in social media showed protesters dressed in swimsuits and raincoats, prepared for the water cannons.
  








      Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, Raki Ap said in the statement that thousands of people had protested “on and next to the A12 with one demand: stop fossil fuel subsidies.”
  

      Dutch actress Carice van Outen, best known for her role as Melisandre in hit TV show, “Game of Thrones,” was reportedly hit by a water cannon and arrested by police at the protest, according to Dutch public broadcaster, NOS. Earlier on Saturday, van Outen posted a video on her Instagram page of musicians playing Beethoven, calling it a “peaceful and musical protest.”
  

      “Most of the activists, 1,539 people, were arrested for violating the Public Demonstrations Act,” the press release said, adding that the Public Prosecution Service will not be pursuing criminal action as it is only a minor criminal offense under Dutch law.
  

      Forty people were arrested for other criminal offenses including obstructing, blocking, vandalism, and insulting, according to the press release. One person was arrested for resisting arrest resulting in injury. These cases remain under review, according to the police.
  

    Arrests in Germany 


      The arrests in the Netherlands come after Germany’s authorities this week conducted a series of raids against the comparable climate activist group Last Generation.
  

      A total of 15 properties in seven German states were searched as part of the raids conducted on behalf of the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (LKA) and the Munich General Public Prosecutor’s Office, authorities said.
  

      The Prosecutor General’s Office in Munich said it had initiated a preliminary investigation “due to numerous criminal complaints from the population” against a total of seven defendants aged 22 to 38 years, “on the charge of forming or supporting a criminal organization.” 
  

      On Germany’s right, political figures were approving of the authorities’ crackdown on the climate group.
  

      The leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Party, Friedrich Merz, wrote on Twitter that causing “mass damage to property, graffiti or memorial plaques, or gluing oneself to the streets or cars are quite simply criminal offenses.” 
  

      He added, “It is correct that police and prosecutors are taking action against the Last Generation and those who finance it.”
  

      Some, though, questioned the move. Die Linke (The Left) Member of Parliament Lorenz Gosta Beutin told Bavarian broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk prosecutors were “putting themselves above our judiciary and courts.”
  

      A member of parliament for Germany’s Green Party, Helge Limburg, agreed that the “blanket assumption” of the group as criminal was legally questionable in an interview with Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
  

      The UK in 2020 threatened to class Extinction Rebellion as an organized crime group, which would have seen activists face jail terms of up to five years, although the plans did not come to fruition.

         — 
    


      “Murderers.” “Criminals.” “We are watching you.”
  

      These are just a handful of the threats and abuse sent to meteorologists at AEMET, Spain’s national weather agency, in recent months. They come via social media, its website, letters, phone calls – even in the form of graffiti sprayed across one of its buildings. 
  

      Abuse and harassment “have always happened” against the agency’s scientists, Estrella Gutiérrez-Marco, spokesperson for AEMET, told CNN. 
  

      But there has been a rapid rise recently, coinciding with extreme weather in Spain. A severe drought has shrunk water levels to alarming lows, exacerbated by record-breaking April temperatures.
  

      The abuse got so bad that in April, AEMET posted a video on Twitter calling for an end to the harassment, and asking for respect. Even the government intervened. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for the ecological transition, posted on Twitter in support of the agency: “Lying, giving wings to conspiracy and fear, insulting … It is time to say enough.”
  

      The harassment of meteorologists by conspiracy theorists and climate deniers is not a phenomenon confined to Spain. 
  







      National weather services, meteorologists and climate communicators in countries from the US to Australia say they’re experiencing an increase in threats and abuse, often around accusations they are overstating, lying about or even controlling the weather.

      In Spain’s case, much of the trolling revolves around the rehashing of an old conspiracy theory: so-called “chemtrails.”  
  

      Under many of the agency’s Twitter posts, especially those that refer to more extreme weather, users have posted images of blue skies, crisscrossed with wispy, white trails. They falsely claim the trails contain a cocktail of chemicals to artificially manipulate the weather – keeping rain away and causing climate change. 
  

      It’s a theory roundly rejected by scientists. 
  

      Airplanes do release vapor trails called contrails, short for condensation trails, which form when water vapor condenses into ice crystals around the small particles emitted by jet engines.
  

      But scientists have been clear: There is no evidence “chemtrails” exist. 
  







    ‘One of the hardest experiences’


      In April, meteorologist Isabel Moreno wrote a tweet saying “rain skips Spain,” with an image of a band of rain stretching across Europe but missing Spain almost entirely. She was completely unprepared for the response. 
  

      “It was one of the hardest experiences in social media in my life,” said Moreno, who appears on the Spanish TV channel RTVE. “I received HUNDREDS of responses to an (apparently) inoffensive tweet,” she told CNN in an email. 
  

      Many accused her of covering up weather manipulation.
  

      “Do not take us for idiots,” said one. “They dry us up, and you are the spokesperson for those who do it,” said another. And on, and on. 
  

      While there were plenty of supportive messages, too, it was scary, Moreno said. “I have never seen either that amount of responses nor that level of aggression.” It took days for her to be able to go onto Twitter again without feeling anxious or stressed.

      This phenomenon may be particularly pronounced in Spain, but it spreads much wider. 
  







      In France, meteorologists have been accused of exaggerating the country’s drought and heat. 
  

      Météo France, the French national meteorological service, said the agency’s communications are “the object of more and more repeated attacks,” a Météo France spokesman told CNN.
  

      Climate misinformation on social media is particularly widespread, he said. It “seems to be on the rise, both in terms of the number of attacks directed against scientific publications but also the increasingly aggressive tone of the insults.” 
  

      In Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology has been bombarded with criticism of its reporting of temperature records, with claims they have been inflated to make climate change seem worse. A spokeswoman for BOM called these claims inaccurate. “The Bureau transparently reports on and provides access to its very large climate data records,” she said.
  

      And in the UK, meteorologists reported unprecedented levels of online harassment during last year’s record-breaking heat wave, which led to the first-ever “red warning” for heat. 
  

      “As scientists communicated this information, they were accused of instigating a nanny state hysteria,” Liz Bentley, the chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told CNN.
  

      The Met Office was even accused of changing the color palette of its maps to make them look more dramatic. “We hadn’t, it was just really hot,” Oliver Claydon, a communications officer at the Met Office, told CNN.

      US meteorologists and climate communicators have not escaped the barrage of abuse and conspiracies. 
  

      “Whenever I posted about global topics, like the yearly temperature report, the comments section would be filled with political jabs and conspiracy theories,” said Elisa Raffa, a broadcast meteorologist with Queen City News, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
  

      As a woman in the media, she more often receives comments about her appearance than the science she’s communicating, she told CNN. 
  

      Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, said she’s seen a ramp up of abuse lately. 
  

      “I receive almost daily verbal declarations of my ignorance and climate alarmism,” she told CNN. 
  

    An erosion of trust


      Some disinformation experts draw a straight line from the conspiracies that flourished during the Covid pandemic – when experts faced a slew of abuse – to the uptick in climate conspiracies. 
  

      People need “trending” topics on which to hang these theories, said Alexandre López-Borrull, a lecturer in the Information and Communication Sciences Department at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya in Spain. 
  

      As Covid-19 fades from the headlines, climate change has become a strong rallying point. There’s been a big increase in “insults directed at all organizations related to the weather,” he told CNN.
  

      “It’s a logical evolution of the broader trend around pushback on institutions, and the erosion of trust,” said Jennie King, the head of Climate Research and Policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank focused on disinformation and extremism.
  

      These kinds of conspiracies are usually grounded in the idea that a set of institutions is “using the pretext of climate change, or the pretext of solving public policy issues, to enact some insidious agenda,” she told CNN.
  

      And the weather is an easy way in. Many aspects of climate science can feel very technical or abstract, but the weather is something people interact with frequently, said King. 
  

      “It’s a much more immediate way to bring a wider audience into that skepticism … planting seeds of doubt against the climate agenda writ large,” she said.

      The role meteorologists have in explaining how climate change affects the weather, especially extreme weather, is a particular flashpoint. 
  

      Extreme weather can be alarming, especially when there are consequences and sacrifices, such as Spain’s water restrictions. 
  

      Conspiracy theories feed on this fear by offering a simple, enticing explanation, said López-Borrull. It’s easier to believe climate change is fake, or a manipulation by powerful people, than get your head around the complex problem and what it means for society.
  

      “Change is hard and scary,” Francis said 
  

    ‘I’m just trying to do my job’


      It’s difficult to combat conspiracy theories when they bubble up. Some experts say they offer simple charts and rebuttals when they can, but try to ignore those who come in bad faith. 
  

      Doug McNeall, a climate scientist and statistician at the Met Office Hadley Centre, a UK research center, said that, as a scientist, he welcomes being challenged. “If people come with better evidence, and you change your mind, that’s good,” he told CNN.  
  

      But that’s not been his recent experience. “These people were not coming with better evidence,” he said. “They were coming to stop us talking about climate science.” He now relies much more on the block button.
  

      Moreno echoed this. “I find it very difficult to change the minds of people that really have strong beliefs in these conspiracies,” she said. It’s easier to prevent the ideas from taking hold in people in the first place by tackling the myths and explaining how the atmosphere works, she added.
  

      This kind of communication can really help, said King. Some of the best initiatives are “when media outlets or scientific institutions really try to demystify the process of how they produce public interest data,” she said.

      King worries about the impact of these conspiracies on climate politics. “If we want to implement any policies, ambitious or not, around the environmental agenda, and the acute crisis of climate change, it does now seem that this is going to rear its head,” she said.
  

      López-Borrull hopes meteorologists and climate communicators will persevere and not be pushed away from online spaces.
  

      “The answer is not disappearing or closing social media profiles … they have to remain on social media because they are really useful,” López-Borrull said.
  

      But as the climate crisis causes more extreme weather, harassment could increase even further. 
  

      And it takes a toll, said Raffa.
  

      “I think it’s easy for people to forget I’m human, some of those comments can be hurtful. I’m just trying to do my job.”

         — 
    


      “Murderers.” “Criminals.” “We are watching you.”
  

      These are just a handful of the threats and abuse sent to meteorologists at AEMET, Spain’s national weather agency, in recent months. They come via social media, its website, letters, phone calls – even in the form of graffiti sprayed across one of its buildings. 
  

      Abuse and harassment “have always happened” against the agency’s scientists, Estrella Gutiérrez-Marco, spokesperson for AEMET, told CNN. 
  

      But there has been a rapid rise recently, coinciding with extreme weather in Spain. A severe drought has shrunk water levels to alarming lows, exacerbated by record-breaking April temperatures.
  

      The abuse got so bad that in April, AEMET posted a video on Twitter calling for an end to the harassment, and asking for respect. Even the government intervened. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for the ecological transition, posted on Twitter in support of the agency: “Lying, giving wings to conspiracy and fear, insulting … It is time to say enough.”
  

      The harassment of meteorologists by conspiracy theorists and climate deniers is not a phenomenon confined to Spain. 
  







      National weather services, meteorologists and climate communicators in countries from the US to Australia say they’re experiencing an increase in threats and abuse, often around accusations they are overstating, lying about or even controlling the weather.

      In Spain’s case, much of the trolling revolves around the rehashing of an old conspiracy theory: so-called “chemtrails.”  
  

      Under many of the agency’s Twitter posts, especially those that refer to more extreme weather, users have posted images of blue skies, crisscrossed with wispy, white trails. They falsely claim the trails contain a cocktail of chemicals to artificially manipulate the weather – keeping rain away and causing climate change. 
  

      It’s a theory roundly rejected by scientists. 
  

      Airplanes do release vapor trails called contrails, short for condensation trails, which form when water vapor condenses into ice crystals around the small particles emitted by jet engines.
  

      But scientists have been clear: There is no evidence “chemtrails” exist. 
  







    ‘One of the hardest experiences’


      In April, meteorologist Isabel Moreno wrote a tweet saying “rain skips Spain,” with an image of a band of rain stretching across Europe but missing Spain almost entirely. She was completely unprepared for the response. 
  

      “It was one of the hardest experiences in social media in my life,” said Moreno, who appears on the Spanish TV channel RTVE. “I received HUNDREDS of responses to an (apparently) inoffensive tweet,” she told CNN in an email. 
  

      Many accused her of covering up weather manipulation.
  

      “Do not take us for idiots,” said one. “They dry us up, and you are the spokesperson for those who do it,” said another. And on, and on. 
  

      While there were plenty of supportive messages, too, it was scary, Moreno said. “I have never seen either that amount of responses nor that level of aggression.” It took days for her to be able to go onto Twitter again without feeling anxious or stressed.

      This phenomenon may be particularly pronounced in Spain, but it spreads much wider. 
  







      In France, meteorologists have been accused of exaggerating the country’s drought and heat. 
  

      Météo France, the French national meteorological service, said the agency’s communications are “the object of more and more repeated attacks,” a Météo France spokesman told CNN.
  

      Climate misinformation on social media is particularly widespread, he said. It “seems to be on the rise, both in terms of the number of attacks directed against scientific publications but also the increasingly aggressive tone of the insults.” 
  

      In Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology has been bombarded with criticism of its reporting of temperature records, with claims they have been inflated to make climate change seem worse. A spokeswoman for BOM called these claims inaccurate. “The Bureau transparently reports on and provides access to its very large climate data records,” she said.
  

      And in the UK, meteorologists reported unprecedented levels of online harassment during last year’s record-breaking heat wave, which led to the first-ever “red warning” for heat. 
  

      “As scientists communicated this information, they were accused of instigating a nanny state hysteria,” Liz Bentley, the chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told CNN.
  

      The Met Office was even accused of changing the color palette of its maps to make them look more dramatic. “We hadn’t, it was just really hot,” Oliver Claydon, a communications officer at the Met Office, told CNN.

      US meteorologists and climate communicators have not escaped the barrage of abuse and conspiracies. 
  

      “Whenever I posted about global topics, like the yearly temperature report, the comments section would be filled with political jabs and conspiracy theories,” said Elisa Raffa, a broadcast meteorologist with Queen City News, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
  

      As a woman in the media, she more often receives comments about her appearance than the science she’s communicating, she told CNN. 
  

      Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, said she’s seen a ramp up of abuse lately. 
  

      “I receive almost daily verbal declarations of my ignorance and climate alarmism,” she told CNN. 
  

    An erosion of trust


      Some disinformation experts draw a straight line from the conspiracies that flourished during the Covid pandemic – when experts faced a slew of abuse – to the uptick in climate conspiracies. 
  

      People need “trending” topics on which to hang these theories, said Alexandre López-Borrull, a lecturer in the Information and Communication Sciences Department at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya in Spain. 
  

      As Covid-19 fades from the headlines, climate change has become a strong rallying point. There’s been a big increase in “insults directed at all organizations related to the weather,” he told CNN.
  

      “It’s a logical evolution of the broader trend around pushback on institutions, and the erosion of trust,” said Jennie King, the head of Climate Research and Policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank focused on disinformation and extremism.
  

      These kinds of conspiracies are usually grounded in the idea that a set of institutions is “using the pretext of climate change, or the pretext of solving public policy issues, to enact some insidious agenda,” she told CNN.
  

      And the weather is an easy way in. Many aspects of climate science can feel very technical or abstract, but the weather is something people interact with frequently, said King. 
  

      “It’s a much more immediate way to bring a wider audience into that skepticism … planting seeds of doubt against the climate agenda writ large,” she said.

      The role meteorologists have in explaining how climate change affects the weather, especially extreme weather, is a particular flashpoint. 
  

      Extreme weather can be alarming, especially when there are consequences and sacrifices, such as Spain’s water restrictions. 
  

      Conspiracy theories feed on this fear by offering a simple, enticing explanation, said López-Borrull. It’s easier to believe climate change is fake, or a manipulation by powerful people, than get your head around the complex problem and what it means for society.
  

      “Change is hard and scary,” Francis said 
  

    ‘I’m just trying to do my job’


      It’s difficult to combat conspiracy theories when they bubble up. Some experts say they offer simple charts and rebuttals when they can, but try to ignore those who come in bad faith. 
  

      Doug McNeall, a climate scientist and statistician at the Met Office Hadley Centre, a UK research center, said that, as a scientist, he welcomes being challenged. “If people come with better evidence, and you change your mind, that’s good,” he told CNN.  
  

      But that’s not been his recent experience. “These people were not coming with better evidence,” he said. “They were coming to stop us talking about climate science.” He now relies much more on the block button.
  

      Moreno echoed this. “I find it very difficult to change the minds of people that really have strong beliefs in these conspiracies,” she said. It’s easier to prevent the ideas from taking hold in people in the first place by tackling the myths and explaining how the atmosphere works, she added.
  

      This kind of communication can really help, said King. Some of the best initiatives are “when media outlets or scientific institutions really try to demystify the process of how they produce public interest data,” she said.

      King worries about the impact of these conspiracies on climate politics. “If we want to implement any policies, ambitious or not, around the environmental agenda, and the acute crisis of climate change, it does now seem that this is going to rear its head,” she said.
  

      López-Borrull hopes meteorologists and climate communicators will persevere and not be pushed away from online spaces.
  

      “The answer is not disappearing or closing social media profiles … they have to remain on social media because they are really useful,” López-Borrull said.
  

      But as the climate crisis causes more extreme weather, harassment could increase even further. 
  

      And it takes a toll, said Raffa.
  

      “I think it’s easy for people to forget I’m human, some of those comments can be hurtful. I’m just trying to do my job.”

      Brazil to host COP30 climate summit in the Amazon in 2025

         — 
    


      The United Nations has chosen Brazil to host the international climate meeting, COP30, in the Amazonian city of Belém do Pará in 2025, the country’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced on Friday.
  

      “I’ve participated in COPs in Egypt, Paris, Copenhagen and all people talk about is the Amazon. So why not have the COP in the Amazon so [people] can get to know the Amazon, see its rivers, its forests, its fauna,” Lula said in a video posted on Twitter.
  

      Foreign Affairs Minister, Mauro Vieira, said the UN approved Brazil’s bid to host COP30 on May 18 after Lula’s request during last year’s COP27 meeting in Egypt.
  







      Belém do Pará is a northern Brazilian city located in the fringes of the Amazon forest. It’s the capital city of the state of Pará located on the coast of the Amazon river estuary. 
  

      The governor of Pará, Helder Barbalho, said in the same video that it is a “great privilege for the whole country” to host the event, saying it “increases the responsibility” of Brazil’s climate agenda regarding the rights of indigenous people and the environment.

Brazil's Lula pitches 'peace coalition' for Ukraine, but he treads a thin line




      Lula has promised to tackle Amazon deforestation and repair the damage to the Amazon caused by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, under whose presidency deforestation surged.
  








      But Lula’s government has come under fire for seemingly backtracking on its climate-related electoral promises in recent days. His administration helped Congress pass a draft law that strips the environment and indigenous people ministries of some powers, weakening their oversight of environmental protections and the demarcation of indigenous lands in the Amazon.  
  

      COP is the yearly United Nations Climate Change Conference, in which states discuss and agree on measures to deal with the environment. This year the 28th edition of the conference will be held in Dubai, according to the UN. The UN’s calendar does not include anything after that yet. 
  

      Last year’s climate summit saw negotiators from nearly 200 countries take the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.
  

      However, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.

      Brazil to host COP30 climate summit in the Amazon in 2025

         — 
    


      The United Nations has chosen Brazil to host the international climate meeting, COP30, in the Amazonian city of Belém do Pará in 2025, the country’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced on Friday.
  

      “I’ve participated in COPs in Egypt, Paris, Copenhagen and all people talk about is the Amazon. So why not have the COP in the Amazon so [people] can get to know the Amazon, see its rivers, its forests, its fauna,” Lula said in a video posted on Twitter.
  

      Foreign Affairs Minister, Mauro Vieira, said the UN approved Brazil’s bid to host COP30 on May 18 after Lula’s request during last year’s COP27 meeting in Egypt.
  







      Belém do Pará is a northern Brazilian city located in the fringes of the Amazon forest. It’s the capital city of the state of Pará located on the coast of the Amazon river estuary. 
  

      The governor of Pará, Helder Barbalho, said in the same video that it is a “great privilege for the whole country” to host the event, saying it “increases the responsibility” of Brazil’s climate agenda regarding the rights of indigenous people and the environment.

Brazil's Lula pitches 'peace coalition' for Ukraine, but he treads a thin line




      Lula has promised to tackle Amazon deforestation and repair the damage to the Amazon caused by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, under whose presidency deforestation surged.
  








      But Lula’s government has come under fire for seemingly backtracking on its climate-related electoral promises in recent days. His administration helped Congress pass a draft law that strips the environment and indigenous people ministries of some powers, weakening their oversight of environmental protections and the demarcation of indigenous lands in the Amazon.  
  

      COP is the yearly United Nations Climate Change Conference, in which states discuss and agree on measures to deal with the environment. This year the 28th edition of the conference will be held in Dubai, according to the UN. The UN’s calendar does not include anything after that yet. 
  

      Last year’s climate summit saw negotiators from nearly 200 countries take the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.
  

      However, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.

      ‘Sounding the alarm’: World on track to breach a critical warming threshold in the next five years

         — 
    


      The world is now likely to breach a key climate threshold for the first time within the next five years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, due to a combination of heat-trapping pollution and a looming El Niño. 
  

      Global temperatures have soared in recent years as the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. And that trend shows no sign of slowing. In its annual climate update, the WMO said that between 2023 and 2027, there is now a 66% chance that the planet’s temperature will climb above 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels for at least one year. 
  

      As temperatures surge, there is also a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years – and the five-year period as a whole – will be the warmest on record for the planet, the WMO reported.
  







      Breaching the 1.5-degree threshold may only be temporary, the WMO said, but it would be the clearest signal yet of how quickly climate change is accelerating – hastening sea level rise, more extreme weather and the demise of vital ecosystems.

Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed




      Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
  

      “This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years. However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas, in a statement.
  








      The temperature increases are fueled by the rise of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels, as well as the predicted arrival of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon with a global heating effect. 
  

      “A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” Taalas said. “This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment. We need to be prepared.”

5 alternative energy sources to speed our transition away from fossil fuels




      The current hottest year on record is 2016, which followed a very strong El Niño event. El Niño tends to ramp up the temperatures the year after it develops, which could put 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record. 
  

      The world has already seen around 1.2 degrees of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution. And despite three years of cooling La Niña, temperatures have soared to dangerous levels. The last eight years were the warmest on record. 
  

      The report stated that the chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius has risen steadily since 2015, when the WMO put the chance of breaching this threshold at close to zero. 
  

      The annual mean global near-surface temperature for each year between 2023 and 2027 is predicted to be between 1.1 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degree Celsius higher than the 1850-1900 average, said the WMO. That refers to the period before the sharp increase of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels.
  

      “Global mean temperatures are predicted to continue increasing, moving us away further and further away from the climate we are used to,” said Leon Hermanson,  a Met Office expert scientist who led the report, in a statement.   
  

    Why does 1.5 degrees matter?


      Scientists have long warned that the world needs to stay within 1.5 degrees of warming to avoid catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes.
  

      Warming above this point increases the risk of triggering major tipping points, including the death of coral reefs and the melting of polar ice sheets, which will add to sea level rise, devastating coastal communities.
  

      In the US alone, 13 million people could be forced to relocate because of sea level rise by the end of the century. For many low-lying Pacific Island nations, warming over 1.5 degrees is a threat to their survival. 
  

      Temperature rises also increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts, storms, wildfires and heatwaves.

      Already this year a slew of temperature records have been broken – and in some cases smashed – across the world. 
  

      In March, parts of Argentina grappled with temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. High temperature records were smashed across large parts of Asia in April, while record-breaking temperatures scorched locations in the Pacific Northwest in May.
  

      Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees could reduce the number of people exposed to extreme heatwaves by around 420 million, according to NASA.
  

    The window to act is closing


      The 1.5 threshold may be important, but it’s not a tipping point in itself. 
  

      With every fraction of a degree the world warms, the worse the effects will be. But, that also means every fraction of a degree by which warming can be reduced, will help.

UN report on climate crisis confirms the world already has solutions -- but politics are getting in the way




      Scientists say that, while the window to act is fact closing, there is still time to reduce global warming by moving away from burning oil, coal and gas and toward clean energy. 
  

      Many have also called for adaptation measures to prepare for the climate impacts that are already baked in, such as vast coastal walls to protect communities from sea level rise.
  

      Countries will meet at the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai at the end of the year, where they will undertake a “global stocktake” – an assessment of their progress toward targets agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement. 
  

      They are expected to be a long way off track on meeting goals to keep within 1.5 degrees of warming by cutting planet-heating pollution by more than 40% by 2030.

      ‘Sounding the alarm’: World on track to breach a critical warming threshold in the next five years

         — 
    


      The world is now likely to breach a key climate threshold for the first time within the next five years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, due to a combination of heat-trapping pollution and a looming El Niño. 
  

      Global temperatures have soared in recent years as the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. And that trend shows no sign of slowing. In its annual climate update, the WMO said that between 2023 and 2027, there is now a 66% chance that the planet’s temperature will climb above 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels for at least one year. 
  

      As temperatures surge, there is also a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years – and the five-year period as a whole – will be the warmest on record for the planet, the WMO reported.
  







      Breaching the 1.5-degree threshold may only be temporary, the WMO said, but it would be the clearest signal yet of how quickly climate change is accelerating – hastening sea level rise, more extreme weather and the demise of vital ecosystems.

They are currently working on ""resilient corals"", The teams of PhD Laetitia Hédouin identify, mark and perform genetic analysis of corals, which are not impacted by thermal stress. They then produce coral cuttings which are grown in a ""coral nursery"" and compared to other colonies studying the resilience capacity of coral. (Photo by Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty Images).

Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed




      Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
  

      “This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years. However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas, in a statement.
  








      The temperature increases are fueled by the rise of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels, as well as the predicted arrival of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon with a global heating effect. 
  

      “A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” Taalas said. “This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment. We need to be prepared.”

5 alternative energy sources to speed our transition away from fossil fuels




      The current hottest year on record is 2016, which followed a very strong El Niño event. El Niño tends to ramp up the temperatures the year after it develops, which could put 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record. 
  

      The world has already seen around 1.2 degrees of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution. And despite three years of cooling La Niña, temperatures have soared to dangerous levels. The last eight years were the warmest on record. 
  

      The report stated that the chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius has risen steadily since 2015, when the WMO put the chance of breaching this threshold at close to zero. 
  

      The annual mean global near-surface temperature for each year between 2023 and 2027 is predicted to be between 1.1 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degree Celsius higher than the 1850-1900 average, said the WMO. That refers to the period before the sharp increase of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels.
  

      “Global mean temperatures are predicted to continue increasing, moving us away further and further away from the climate we are used to,” said Leon Hermanson,  a Met Office expert scientist who led the report, in a statement.   
  

    Why does 1.5 degrees matter?


      Scientists have long warned that the world needs to stay within 1.5 degrees of warming to avoid catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes.
  

      Warming above this point increases the risk of triggering major tipping points, including the death of coral reefs and the melting of polar ice sheets, which will add to sea level rise, devastating coastal communities.
  

      In the US alone, 13 million people could be forced to relocate because of sea level rise by the end of the century. For many low-lying Pacific Island nations, warming over 1.5 degrees is a threat to their survival. 
  

      Temperature rises also increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts, storms, wildfires and heatwaves.

      Already this year a slew of temperature records have been broken – and in some cases smashed – across the world. 
  

      In March, parts of Argentina grappled with temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. High temperature records were smashed across large parts of Asia in April, while record-breaking temperatures scorched locations in the Pacific Northwest in May.
  

      Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees could reduce the number of people exposed to extreme heatwaves by around 420 million, according to NASA.
  

    The window to act is closing


      The 1.5 threshold may be important, but it’s not a tipping point in itself. 
  

      With every fraction of a degree the world warms, the worse the effects will be. But, that also means every fraction of a degree by which warming can be reduced, will help.

      Scientists say that, while the window to act is fact closing, there is still time to reduce global warming by moving away from burning oil, coal and gas and toward clean energy. 
  

      Many have also called for adaptation measures to prepare for the climate impacts that are already baked in, such as vast coastal walls to protect communities from sea level rise.
  

      Countries will meet at the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai at the end of the year, where they will undertake a “global stocktake” – an assessment of their progress toward targets agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement. 
  

      They are expected to be a long way off track on meeting goals to keep within 1.5 degrees of warming by cutting planet-heating pollution by more than 40% by 2030.

      The UAE embassy in Damascus said in a post on Twitter on Sunday that Assad had received an invitation to attend COP28 from Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi.
  

      Syria state-run news agency SANA also confirmed the invitation on Monday.
  







      If Assad attends, it would be his first global summit since the start of the country’s brutal civil war in 2011, and could cause diplomatic tensions for countries which continue to impose sanctions on his regime. 
  









Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, Minister of State of the United Arab Emirates, CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. and COP28 President-designate,  speaks at the 14th Petersberg Climate Dialogue at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin on May 2.

COP28 president says fossil fuels still have a role to play, prompting concerns about climate summit's goals




      The UN climate summit has already attracted controversy for appointing as its president Sultan Al Jaber, the CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers.
  

      A COP28 spokesperson told Reuters in a statement this week: “COP28 is committed to an inclusive COP process that produces transformational solutions. This can only happen if we have everyone in the room.”
  








      In March, Assad visited the UAE on an official invitation for the first time since the Syrian civil war began. It was also his first visit to an Arab state since 2011.
  

      Earlier this month, Arab nations agreed to re-admit Syria into the Arab League despite repeated objections from the United States to ending the more than decade-long isolation of a regime that it holds accountable for the deaths of more than 300,000 civilians and displacement of millions in the country’s civil war.

         — 
    


      The United Arab Emirates has invited Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to attend the United Nations’ COP28 Climate Summit, which will take place from November 30 in Dubai.
  

      The UAE embassy in Damascus said in a post on Twitter on Sunday that Assad had received an invitation to attend COP28 from Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi.
  

      Syria state-run news agency SANA also confirmed the invitation on Monday.
  







      If Assad attends, it would be his first global summit since the start of the country’s brutal civil war in 2011, and could cause diplomatic tensions for countries which continue to impose sanctions on his regime. 
  









Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, Minister of State of the United Arab Emirates, CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. and COP28 President-designate,  speaks at the 14th Petersberg Climate Dialogue at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin on May 2.

COP28 president says fossil fuels still have a role to play, prompting concerns about climate summit's goals




      The UN climate summit has already attracted controversy for appointing as its president Sultan Al Jaber, the CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers.
  

      A COP28 spokesperson told Reuters in a statement this week: “COP28 is committed to an inclusive COP process that produces transformational solutions. This can only happen if we have everyone in the room.”
  








      In March, Assad visited the UAE on an official invitation for the first time since the Syrian civil war began. It was also his first visit to an Arab state since 2011.
  

      Earlier this month, Arab nations agreed to re-admit Syria into the Arab League despite repeated objections from the United States to ending the more than decade-long isolation of a regime that it holds accountable for the deaths of more than 300,000 civilians and displacement of millions in the country’s civil war.

         — 
    


      Millions of acres scorched by wildfires in the Western US and Canada — an area roughly the size of South Carolina — can be traced back to carbon pollution from the world’s largest fossil fuel and cement companies, scientists reported Tuesday.  
  

      The study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that 37% of the area burned by wildfires in the West since 1986 — nearly 19.8 million acres out of 53 million — can be blamed on the planet-cooking pollution from 88 of the world’s major fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers, the latter of which have been shown to produce around 7% of all carbon dioxide emissions.
  

      The amalgam of megadrought and record-breaking heat that’s drying out vegetation due to climate change has stoked the West’s wildfires. And researchers found that since 1901, the fossil fuel activities of these companies, including ExxonMobil and BP, among others, warmed the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius — nearly half of the global increase during that period. 
  







      Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Science Hub for Climate Litigation at the Union of Concerned Scientists and co-author on the study, said the findings add to a significant library of research that directly links climate change or the impacts of the crisis to burning fossil fuel.

      “We know that many of these companies have known for decades about the consequences of climate change,” Phillips told CNN, referring to several studies and award-winning reports that have shown fossil fuel executives knew of but downplayed the growing threat. “But instead of sharing that information with the public, they engaged in this deliberate misinformation campaign to deceive the general public and cast doubt on climate science.” 
  

      Fossil fuel companies have denied the conclusions of those reports.  
  








      “The clear agenda of this group aside, America’s oil and natural gas industry is focused on delivering affordable, reliable energy while reducing emissions,” Christina Noel, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry in the US, told CNN in an email.
  

      BP and Exxon have announced goals to achieve net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050. CNN reached out to BP and ExxonMobil about Tuesday’s study, but did not hear back in time for publication.

      The study comes as firefighters in Alberta, Canada, fight dozens of wildfires in the forest protection area of the province — fires that are being exacerbated by a dangerous heat wave with record-breaking temperatures in Western Canada and the US Pacific Northwest. 
  

      Researchers behind the study came to their conclusions using a method that scientists have relied on in recent years to quantify how much of a role the climate crisis is playing in extreme weather and environmental disasters: They took actual climate data and compare it to an idealized, modeled version of the world where there was no fossil fuel pollution from the 88 companies.  
  

      One metric they focused on was the region’s so-called vapor pressure deficit — or how thirsty the atmosphere is for moisture.  It is a key indicator of fire danger and drought, Phillips said, and measures how much the air is sucking moisture out of soil and plants, which then ultimately become fuel for wildfires.  
  

      The methodology is “simple,” said Caroline Juang, researcher with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.

      “The study takes what we know about the strong relationship between climate and burned area, and extends this understanding to the role of big fossil fuel emitters,” Juang, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “The authors use how global mean temperatures scales with [vapor pressure deficit] and then looks at how changes in [vapor pressure deficit] will change burned areas.” 
  

      The researchers also accounted for aerosol pollution, which unlike planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide or methane, reflects sunlight back to space and has a cooling effect. Major oil and gas companies contribute roughly two-thirds of total industrial aerosol emissions, according to the study, which used fossil fuel emissions data through 2015, the latest available, and held figures constant from 2015 to 2021. 
  

      Jatan Buch, a postdoctoral research scientist in the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, who was also not involved with the study, said that while vapor pressure deficit is the leading driver of year-to-year variability in burned area across the region, other factors play a role and should be examined in future studies. According to the study, those include precipitation and snowpack conditions and prescribed burns and fire suppression efforts that have led to a buildup of vegetation that help fuel fires. 
  

      The report also noted that development and growth contributed to a higher risk of human behavior-caused fires, with more people and property in harm’s way.

      In recent years, fires have exhibited increasingly explosive behavior — leading to larger burned areas, more aggressive nighttime fires and even massive fire-induced tornadoes like in the Carr Fire in California in 2018. The largest fires are also pouring smoke into the atmosphere, which can be transported large distances, impacting millions with poor air quality potentially hundreds of miles away. 
  

      “Even if you’re not living near the fire, you can still feel those impacts,” Phillips said. “What public health experts share is that there’s no amount of exposure to wildfire smoke that’s safe.”

      Climate scientists have said human-caused climate change plays a key role in making these extreme fire events worse and more likely to happen. Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, said that’s why this study is so important.  
  

      “It shows how quickly the science about climate change causes is moving and gives us vital information about the very real harms to people from pollution from burning coal, oil and gas,” Marlon, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. 
  

      “The failure of fossil fuel companies to abate their emissions after recognizing the climate risk of their activities in the mid-1960s is even more reprehensible,” Buch told CNN. “The continued greenhouse gas emissions due to these companies’ products in the late 20th century resulted in loading the dice for the western US climate toward a hotter and drier future with a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires.” 
  

      Phillips said the key message they want people to take away from this study is that fossil fuel companies need to be held accountable for exacerbating extreme climate events like wildfires, which are putting lives at risk. 
  

      “It didn’t have to be this way,” she said. They “should pay their fair share of the costs of these climate impacts.”

      More than a third of the area charred by wildfires in Western North America can be traced back to fossil fuels, scientists find

         — 
    


      Millions of acres scorched by wildfires in the Western US and Canada — an area roughly the size of South Carolina — can be traced back to carbon pollution from the world’s largest fossil fuel and cement companies, scientists reported Tuesday.  
  

      The study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that 37% of the area burned by wildfires in the West since 1986 — nearly 19.8 million acres out of 53 million — can be blamed on the planet-cooking pollution from 88 of the world’s major fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers, the latter of which have been shown to produce around 7% of all carbon dioxide emissions.
  

      The amalgam of megadrought and record-breaking heat that’s drying out vegetation due to climate change has stoked the West’s wildfires. And researchers found that since 1901, the fossil fuel activities of these companies, including ExxonMobil and BP, among others, warmed the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius — nearly half of the global increase during that period. 
  







      Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Science Hub for Climate Litigation at the Union of Concerned Scientists and co-author on the study, said the findings add to a significant library of research that directly links climate change or the impacts of the crisis to burning fossil fuel.

      “We know that many of these companies have known for decades about the consequences of climate change,” Phillips told CNN, referring to several studies and award-winning reports that have shown fossil fuel executives knew of but downplayed the growing threat. “But instead of sharing that information with the public, they engaged in this deliberate misinformation campaign to deceive the general public and cast doubt on climate science.” 
  

      Fossil fuel companies have denied the conclusions of those reports.  
  








      “The clear agenda of this group aside, America’s oil and natural gas industry is focused on delivering affordable, reliable energy while reducing emissions,” Christina Noel, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry in the US, told CNN in an email.
  

      BP and Exxon have announced goals to achieve net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050. CNN reached out to BP and ExxonMobil about Tuesday’s study, but did not hear back in time for publication.

      The study comes as firefighters in Alberta, Canada, fight dozens of wildfires in the forest protection area of the province — fires that are being exacerbated by a dangerous heat wave with record-breaking temperatures in Western Canada and the US Pacific Northwest. 
  

      Researchers behind the study came to their conclusions using a method that scientists have relied on in recent years to quantify how much of a role the climate crisis is playing in extreme weather and environmental disasters: They took actual climate data and compare it to an idealized, modeled version of the world where there was no fossil fuel pollution from the 88 companies.  
  

      One metric they focused on was the region’s so-called vapor pressure deficit — or how thirsty the atmosphere is for moisture.  It is a key indicator of fire danger and drought, Phillips said, and measures how much the air is sucking moisture out of soil and plants, which then ultimately become fuel for wildfires.  
  

      The methodology is “simple,” said Caroline Juang, researcher with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.

      “The study takes what we know about the strong relationship between climate and burned area, and extends this understanding to the role of big fossil fuel emitters,” Juang, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “The authors use how global mean temperatures scales with [vapor pressure deficit] and then looks at how changes in [vapor pressure deficit] will change burned areas.” 
  

      The researchers also accounted for aerosol pollution, which unlike planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide or methane, reflects sunlight back to space and has a cooling effect. Major oil and gas companies contribute roughly two-thirds of total industrial aerosol emissions, according to the study, which used fossil fuel emissions data through 2015, the latest available, and held figures constant from 2015 to 2021. 
  

      Jatan Buch, a postdoctoral research scientist in the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, who was also not involved with the study, said that while vapor pressure deficit is the leading driver of year-to-year variability in burned area across the region, other factors play a role and should be examined in future studies. According to the study, those include precipitation and snowpack conditions and prescribed burns and fire suppression efforts that have led to a buildup of vegetation that help fuel fires. 
  

      The report also noted that development and growth contributed to a higher risk of human behavior-caused fires, with more people and property in harm’s way.

      In recent years, fires have exhibited increasingly explosive behavior — leading to larger burned areas, more aggressive nighttime fires and even massive fire-induced tornadoes like in the Carr Fire in California in 2018. The largest fires are also pouring smoke into the atmosphere, which can be transported large distances, impacting millions with poor air quality potentially hundreds of miles away. 
  

      “Even if you’re not living near the fire, you can still feel those impacts,” Phillips said. “What public health experts share is that there’s no amount of exposure to wildfire smoke that’s safe.”

      Climate scientists have said human-caused climate change plays a key role in making these extreme fire events worse and more likely to happen. Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, said that’s why this study is so important.  
  

      “It shows how quickly the science about climate change causes is moving and gives us vital information about the very real harms to people from pollution from burning coal, oil and gas,” Marlon, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. 
  

      “The failure of fossil fuel companies to abate their emissions after recognizing the climate risk of their activities in the mid-1960s is even more reprehensible,” Buch told CNN. “The continued greenhouse gas emissions due to these companies’ products in the late 20th century resulted in loading the dice for the western US climate toward a hotter and drier future with a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires.” 
  

      Phillips said the key message they want people to take away from this study is that fossil fuel companies need to be held accountable for exacerbating extreme climate events like wildfires, which are putting lives at risk. 
  

      “It didn’t have to be this way,” she said. They “should pay their fair share of the costs of these climate impacts.”

      Why John Kerry is confident Biden’s climate policies can survive a Republican president

         — 
    


      As the US barrels into a high-stakes and consequential election cycle, US climate envoy and former Secretary of State John Kerry is confident of one thing: If a Republican is elected president, they won’t be able to reverse the Biden administration’s wins on climate change and clean energy. 
  

      The economy has so drastically and fundamentally changed in the past several years, Kerry argued – spurred in large part by the Democrats’ climate and energy law passed last year – that the markets would reject a challenge to the nation’s clean energy trajectory.
  

      “I don’t think anybody elected president – Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative – could change what is happening today,” President Joe Biden’s top climate diplomat told CNN in a candid and wide-ranging interview in his State Department office.

      “The power of the marketplace is bigger than the presidency on (climate change) now,” Kerry said. “So much money has been invested in retooling and redirecting business strategies and investments.” 
  

      Kerry has been pleasantly surprised at the pace that clean energy manufacturing, electric vehicle and battery factories are flocking to the US, and noted EU officials are “a little annoyed” about generous US clean energy subsidies drawing business away from them.   
  

      “Our message to them is ‘do the same thing; let’s get going,’” Kerry told CNN. “We have made a giant leap forward.”  
  








      The 79-year-old Kerry – who has served as Biden’s climate envoy long after Washington insiders assumed he would retire – is gearing up for his third international climate summit this November in Dubai. He speaks to Biden “when I need to talk to him” and described the president as “super seized” by international climate issues.

      Despite whispers of a possible retirement that started two years ago, he’s outlasted multiple staff members, visited Mexico, Brazil, Europe and Japan this year alone, and is showing few signs of slowing.  
  

      Kerry and his team are actively working on an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua after Xie recently recovered from a serious illness for which he was hospitalized, Kerry said. There is still lots of unfinished business between the US and China, the world’s two largest emitters.  
  

      “At some point, we’re going to travel over there and pick up where we left off,” Kerry said. 
  

    Negotiations with China 


      Sitting behind his desk, Kerry ticked off three issues he hopes to resolve with China: the country implementing its plan to cut emissions of super-polluting methane, demonstrating it can move away from coal faster and working together on the issue of deforestation. 
  

      “Those are the three things that are on the table as a result of the meetings that we had” last year, Kerry said. “Now, we’d like to go further, and we think there are things that we could cooperate on.” 
  

      Kerry and Xie have known each other for 25 years, Kerry said. And their work together has been a relative bright spot amid a thorny US and China relationship.

      But the climate envoys haven’t been immune; China abruptly pulled out of ongoing climate talks last year after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan in the face of fierce objection from China. The two countries agreed to resume at COP27 in Egypt late last year, but Kerry got Covid at the conference, leaving little time for actual negotiation. 
  

      China announced in 2021 that it would develop a plan to limit emissions of methane – an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that scientists have focused on in recent years as a critical climate issue. Kerry said he has seen China’s methane plan but told CNN he is not sure if they have updated or strengthened it since.  
  

      “It’s very possible; they’ve been deploying a lot of renewables in the last six, seven months,” Kerry said. “I’m not sure whether their plans may have shifted, that’s part of what we need to talk about.” 
  

    A world off-track 


      Though he was optimistic about cooperation with China, Kerry was blunt about the world’s chances to stave off the worst of the climate crisis. Nations are way off-track on their goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
  

      “No,” he told CNN. “Tragically, right now, not enough people are doing enough to achieve that goal.”  
  

      Kerry said he was heartened to see some countries, including the US, making significant progress by moving to clean energy. But there are still too many that are moving slowly from fossil fuels – particularly the dirtiest one, coal. 
  

      “What is not exciting is there’s too much coal use still and too much unabated fossil fuel emissions that are fouling the air,” Kerry said. “We need to move much faster to bring ourselves in alignment with the 1.5-degree goal.”

      Kerry noted India has set an aggressive target of adding 500 gigawatts of renewable energy to its grid, even as it remains highly dependent on coal.  
  

      “That’s a huge goal,” Kerry said. “They’re pushing very hard to try to achieve that. We want to help them, bringing finance to the table or other things. And if they do that, they would be in alignment with 1.5 [degrees Celsius].” 
  

      Kerry added that it is difficult for climate models to quantify how quickly progress is being made as the Inflation Reduction Act spurs private investment in clean energy, which he called a “monumental accomplishment.” 
  

      “That’s one of the things I find really super encouraging,” Kerry said. “I don’t think any of us who are looking at these models have an ability to be able to define, with accuracy, what the impact is of all the investment, all the private sector decisions that get made. I truly believe that we’re in a better place than we’ve been in a number of years because of the changes that are taking place.” 
  

    House Republican investigations 


      The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into Kerry’s role in the administration, and the “nature” of his negotiations with China. Kerry told CNN he hopes his climate negotiations are not politicized. 
  

      “This is not a partisan issue. This should have nothing to do with politics,” Kerry said. “We’re all looking for the best marketplace solutions, the best things that we can do to create jobs, accelerate the transition, increase the health and safety of Americans by cleaning up the air and getting rid of the pollution.” 
  

      Kerry also said he has been in touch with House Republicans on climate proactively, meeting with the Conservative Climate Caucus, a group chaired by Rep. John Curtis of Utah.  
  

      “I think we’re going to maybe get a smaller group together; we talked about getting together,” Kerry said. “I’m open to talking anytime.” 
  

    ‘Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good’ 


      Despite Biden’s significant climate wins in Congress, the president has taken a hit among young voters for approving the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska earlier this year.

What is carbon capture? Some say it will help save the world, for others it's a dangerous distraction




      While Kerry reiterated that the Biden administration was legally hamstrung by previously contracts with oil company ConocoPhillips, he encouraged youth activists and voters to look at the bigger picture of the administration’s climate progress. 
  

      “Look at the difference between Donald Trump, if that’s the nominee, or any other Republican who haven’t stepped up in this issue, and what the Biden administration is doing,” Kerry said. “And don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” 
  

      But the Vietnam veteran and former anti-war activist added he sympathized with young people and encouraged them to continue to speak up. 
  

      “I understand the feelings people have about Willow; there is an appearance of a contradiction because you see some drilling possibilities even as you’re trying to move away from dependency on unabated fossil fuels,” Kerry said. “Wherever I go, I ask young people, ‘Look, let’s be more militant, all of us.’ We’ve got to go out and demand more, push for more, and don’t take ‘less-than’ for an answer.”

      Why John Kerry is confident Biden’s climate policies can survive a Republican president

         — 
    


      As the US barrels into a high-stakes and consequential election cycle, US climate envoy and former Secretary of State John Kerry is confident of one thing: If a Republican is elected president, they won’t be able to reverse the Biden administration’s wins on climate change and clean energy. 
  

      The economy has so drastically and fundamentally changed in the past several years, Kerry argued – spurred in large part by the Democrats’ climate and energy law passed last year – that the markets would reject a challenge to the nation’s clean energy trajectory.
  

      “I don’t think anybody elected president – Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative – could change what is happening today,” President Joe Biden’s top climate diplomat told CNN in a candid and wide-ranging interview in his State Department office.

      “The power of the marketplace is bigger than the presidency on (climate change) now,” Kerry said. “So much money has been invested in retooling and redirecting business strategies and investments.” 
  

      Kerry has been pleasantly surprised at the pace that clean energy manufacturing, electric vehicle and battery factories are flocking to the US, and noted EU officials are “a little annoyed” about generous US clean energy subsidies drawing business away from them.   
  

      “Our message to them is ‘do the same thing; let’s get going,’” Kerry told CNN. “We have made a giant leap forward.”  
  








      The 79-year-old Kerry – who has served as Biden’s climate envoy long after Washington insiders assumed he would retire – is gearing up for his third international climate summit this November in Dubai. He speaks to Biden “when I need to talk to him” and described the president as “super seized” by international climate issues.

      Despite whispers of a possible retirement that started two years ago, he’s outlasted multiple staff members, visited Mexico, Brazil, Europe and Japan this year alone, and is showing few signs of slowing.  
  

      Kerry and his team are actively working on an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua after Xie recently recovered from a serious illness for which he was hospitalized, Kerry said. There is still lots of unfinished business between the US and China, the world’s two largest emitters.  
  

      “At some point, we’re going to travel over there and pick up where we left off,” Kerry said. 
  

    Negotiations with China 


      Sitting behind his desk, Kerry ticked off three issues he hopes to resolve with China: the country implementing its plan to cut emissions of super-polluting methane, demonstrating it can move away from coal faster and working together on the issue of deforestation. 
  

      “Those are the three things that are on the table as a result of the meetings that we had” last year, Kerry said. “Now, we’d like to go further, and we think there are things that we could cooperate on.” 
  

      Kerry and Xie have known each other for 25 years, Kerry said. And their work together has been a relative bright spot amid a thorny US and China relationship.

      But the climate envoys haven’t been immune; China abruptly pulled out of ongoing climate talks last year after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan in the face of fierce objection from China. The two countries agreed to resume at COP27 in Egypt late last year, but Kerry got Covid at the conference, leaving little time for actual negotiation. 
  

      China announced in 2021 that it would develop a plan to limit emissions of methane – an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that scientists have focused on in recent years as a critical climate issue. Kerry said he has seen China’s methane plan but told CNN he is not sure if they have updated or strengthened it since.  
  

      “It’s very possible; they’ve been deploying a lot of renewables in the last six, seven months,” Kerry said. “I’m not sure whether their plans may have shifted, that’s part of what we need to talk about.” 
  

    A world off-track 


      Though he was optimistic about cooperation with China, Kerry was blunt about the world’s chances to stave off the worst of the climate crisis. Nations are way off-track on their goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
  

      “No,” he told CNN. “Tragically, right now, not enough people are doing enough to achieve that goal.”  
  

      Kerry said he was heartened to see some countries, including the US, making significant progress by moving to clean energy. But there are still too many that are moving slowly from fossil fuels – particularly the dirtiest one, coal. 
  

      “What is not exciting is there’s too much coal use still and too much unabated fossil fuel emissions that are fouling the air,” Kerry said. “We need to move much faster to bring ourselves in alignment with the 1.5-degree goal.”

      Kerry noted India has set an aggressive target of adding 500 gigawatts of renewable energy to its grid, even as it remains highly dependent on coal.  
  

      “That’s a huge goal,” Kerry said. “They’re pushing very hard to try to achieve that. We want to help them, bringing finance to the table or other things. And if they do that, they would be in alignment with 1.5 [degrees Celsius].” 
  

      Kerry added that it is difficult for climate models to quantify how quickly progress is being made as the Inflation Reduction Act spurs private investment in clean energy, which he called a “monumental accomplishment.” 
  

      “That’s one of the things I find really super encouraging,” Kerry said. “I don’t think any of us who are looking at these models have an ability to be able to define, with accuracy, what the impact is of all the investment, all the private sector decisions that get made. I truly believe that we’re in a better place than we’ve been in a number of years because of the changes that are taking place.” 
  

    House Republican investigations 


      The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into Kerry’s role in the administration, and the “nature” of his negotiations with China. Kerry told CNN he hopes his climate negotiations are not politicized. 
  

      “This is not a partisan issue. This should have nothing to do with politics,” Kerry said. “We’re all looking for the best marketplace solutions, the best things that we can do to create jobs, accelerate the transition, increase the health and safety of Americans by cleaning up the air and getting rid of the pollution.” 
  

      Kerry also said he has been in touch with House Republicans on climate proactively, meeting with the Conservative Climate Caucus, a group chaired by Rep. John Curtis of Utah.  
  

      “I think we’re going to maybe get a smaller group together; we talked about getting together,” Kerry said. “I’m open to talking anytime.” 
  

    ‘Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good’ 


      Despite Biden’s significant climate wins in Congress, the president has taken a hit among young voters for approving the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska earlier this year.

      While Kerry reiterated that the Biden administration was legally hamstrung by previously contracts with oil company ConocoPhillips, he encouraged youth activists and voters to look at the bigger picture of the administration’s climate progress. 
  

      “Look at the difference between Donald Trump, if that’s the nominee, or any other Republican who haven’t stepped up in this issue, and what the Biden administration is doing,” Kerry said. “And don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” 
  

      But the Vietnam veteran and former anti-war activist added he sympathized with young people and encouraged them to continue to speak up. 
  

      “I understand the feelings people have about Willow; there is an appearance of a contradiction because you see some drilling possibilities even as you’re trying to move away from dependency on unabated fossil fuels,” Kerry said. “Wherever I go, I ask young people, ‘Look, let’s be more militant, all of us.’ We’ve got to go out and demand more, push for more, and don’t take ‘less-than’ for an answer.”
